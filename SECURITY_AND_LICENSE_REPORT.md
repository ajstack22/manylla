#### 2. PostCSS
- **Package**: postcss <8.4.31
- **Issue**: Line return parsing error
- **Affected Through**: resolve-url-loader → react-scripts
- **Recommendation**: Development dependency, lower risk

#### 3. Webpack Dev Server
- **Package**: webpack-dev-server <=5.2.0
- **Issue**: Source code exposure vulnerability
- **Note**: Only affects development environment, not production
- **Recommendation**: Safe for production deployment

## License Compliance Analysis

### License Distribution
```
MIT                     : 1505 packages (84.5%)
ISC                     : 77 packages (4.3%)
BSD-2-Clause            : 45 packages (2.5%)
Apache-2.0              : 43 packages (2.4%)
CC0-1.0                 : 42 packages (2.4%)
BSD-3-Clause            : 41 packages (2.3%)
Other Permissive        : 26 packages (1.5%)
CC-BY-4.0               : 1 package (0.06%)
UNLICENSED              : 1 package (0.06%)
```

### License Compliance Status: ✅ COMPLIANT

#### Permissive Licenses (99.9%)
All major dependencies use permissive open source licenses that allow:
- Commercial use
- Modification
- Distribution
- Private use

#### Notable Licenses
1. **MIT License** (84.5%): Most permissive, minimal restrictions
2. **Apache-2.0** (2.4%): Permissive with patent grant
3. **BSD Variants** (4.8%): Permissive with attribution
4. **ISC** (4.3%): Simplified MIT-style license

#### Special Considerations
1. **CC-BY-4.0** (caniuse-lite): Creative Commons Attribution
   - Used for browser compatibility data
   - Requires attribution when redistributing data
   - Acceptable for production use

2. **MPL-2.0** (1 package): Mozilla Public License
   - Weak copyleft, file-level
   - Compatible with commercial use

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **No Critical Actions Required** - All licenses are production-compatible

### Security Improvements (Optional)
1. **Markdown Libraries**: Consider evaluating alternatives to simple-markdown for better security
2. **Development Dependencies**: The majority of vulnerabilities are in dev dependencies and don't affect production

### License Management
1. **Attribution File**: Create a LICENSES.txt file with attributions for:
   - CC-BY-4.0 (caniuse-lite)
   - Apache-2.0 packages (if redistributing)
   
2. **Regular Audits**: Run quarterly license and security audits

## Production Deployment Status
✅ **APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**
- No blocking security vulnerabilities in production dependencies
- All licenses are commercially compatible
- No copyleft licenses that would require source disclosure

## Compliance Checklist
- [x] No GPL/AGPL/LGPL licenses
- [x] All licenses allow commercial use
- [x] No high-severity production vulnerabilities
- [x] Attribution requirements documented
- [x] License report generated (license-report.csv)
