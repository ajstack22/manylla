# Tech Debt Draft: Web Bundle Size Optimization

## Discovery Context
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Discovered During**: Platform Alias Migration
- **Discovered By**: Peer Reviewer
- **Current Workaround**: None - accepting large bundle for now

## Problem Description
The web build produces a bundle size of 7.71 MB, which is significantly larger than optimal for web applications. The main culprit is the Material-UI library at 6.28 MB. This affects initial page load times and user experience, especially on slower connections.

## Impact Analysis
- **User Impact**: High - Slow initial load times
- **Developer Impact**: Low - No development impediment
- **System Impact**: Medium - Affects performance metrics
- **Risk if Unaddressed**: Poor user experience, high bounce rates, SEO impact

## Proposed Solution
1. Implement code splitting for Material-UI components
2. Use dynamic imports for heavy components
3. Tree-shake unused MUI components
4. Consider lighter alternatives for simple components
5. Implement lazy loading for non-critical paths

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bundle size reduced to < 5 MB
- [ ] Initial load time < 3 seconds on 3G
- [ ] All functionality preserved
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score > 80

## Effort Estimate
- **Research**: 4 hours
- **Implementation**: 16 hours
- **Testing**: 8 hours
- **Total**: L (Large)

## Priority Scoring
- **Urgency**: 3 (Important but not critical)
- **Value**: 4 (High user value)
- **Effort**: 4 (Significant effort)
- **Score**: 3.0 (3 ร 4 รท 4)

## Dependencies
- Webpack configuration knowledge
- Understanding of MUI component usage
- Performance testing tools setup

## Notes
- Current bundle analysis shows:
  - @mui/material: 6.28 MB
  - react-dom: 0.5 MB
  - Other dependencies: 0.93 MB
- Consider using bundle analyzer to identify other optimization opportunities
- May need to evaluate MUI alternatives if size cannot be reduced sufficiently
