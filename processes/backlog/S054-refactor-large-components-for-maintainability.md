# Story S054*: Refactor Large Components for Maintainability

## Overview
Break down components over 500 lines into smaller, focused components

## Status
- **Priority**: P2
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Created**: 2025-09-15
- **Assigned**: Unassigned
- **Type**: PERFORMANCE

## Background
SonarQube maintainability requires files under 500 lines. We have 8+ components exceeding this limit, with SyncDialog at 1081 lines.

## Requirements
1. Refactor SyncDialog.js from 1081 lines
2. Refactor PrintPreview.js from 945 lines
3. Refactor ShareDialogOptimized.js from 855 lines
4. Maintain 100% feature parity
5. No performance degradation

## Success Metrics
```bash
# Verification commands
No files over 500 lines,All tests still pass,Bundle size not increased by more than 5%
```

## Implementation Guidelines
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility  
- Update relevant documentation
- Add appropriate tests
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Manylla coding conventions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] All success metrics pass
- [x] Tests written and passing
- [x] All platforms verified (Web, iOS, Android)
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code review completed
- [x] No console errors or warnings

## Completion Summary
- **Completed**: 2025-09-15
- **Refactored Components**:
  1. SyncDialog.js: 1081 → 73 lines (SyncDialogCore + 5 sub-components)
  2. PrintPreview.js: 945 → 317 lines (+ 8 sub-components)
  3. ShareDialogOptimized.js: 855 → 170 lines (ShareDialog + 6 sub-components)
