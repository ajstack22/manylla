4. Add tests for security-critical functions
5. Verify no new vulnerabilities introduced

## Success Metrics
```bash
# Verification commands
0 unreviewed security hotspots,Security tests added,No new vulnerabilities introduced
```

## Implementation Guidelines
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility  
- Update relevant documentation
- Add appropriate tests
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Manylla coding conventions

## Acceptance Criteria
