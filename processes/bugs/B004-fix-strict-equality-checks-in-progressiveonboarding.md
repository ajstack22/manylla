# Bug B004: Fix Strict Equality Checks in ProgressiveOnboarding

## Overview
**Severity**: Critical
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: OPEN
**Reported**: 2025-09-15
**Reporter**: SonarQube

## Description
SonarQube detected type comparison issues in ProgressiveOnboarding.js where the `mode` state variable is initialized as `null` but compared with strings using strict equality (===) throughout the component. This causes comparisons to fail when mode is null.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open src/components/Onboarding/ProgressiveOnboarding.js
2. Note that `mode` is initialized as `null` (line 18)
3. Check lines where mode is compared with strings: 48, 70, 102-106, 111, 141, 443, 468
4. These comparisons fail when mode is null

## Expected Behavior
Comparisons should work correctly based on intended logic

## Actual Behavior
Strict equality checks fail due to type mismatches

## Environment
- **Platform**: All
- **Version**: Current
- **Device**: N/A (Code issue)
- **OS**: N/A

## Impact Analysis
- **User Impact**: High - Onboarding flow may not work correctly
- **Frequency**: Always (code defect)
- **Workaround**: None
- **Affected Users**: All new users

## Root Cause Analysis
`mode` state is initialized as `null` but compared with strings like "demo", "join", "fresh" using strict equality. Since null !== "string", these comparisons fail until mode is set to a string value.

## Proposed Fix
1. Initialize `mode` with a default string value (e.g., "fresh") instead of null
2. OR add explicit null checks before string comparisons
3. OR use loose equality (==) where appropriate
4. Ensure consistent handling throughout the component

## Verification Steps
```javascript
// Current problematic code:
const [mode, setMode] = useState(null);
// Later:
if (mode === "demo") // false when mode is null

// Fixed version:
const [mode, setMode] = useState("fresh");
// OR:
if (mode && mode === "demo") // handles null case
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bug no longer reproducible
- [ ] Root cause identified and fixed
- [ ] Tests added to prevent regression
- [ ] All platforms verified
- [ ] No new issues introduced
