# Epic Review Process - Multi-Story Adversarial Framework

## OVERVIEW
This process manages large-scale implementations consisting of multiple related stories. It uses adversarial review at both the story level AND epic level to ensure comprehensive validation.

## PROCESS STRUCTURE

```
EPIC
├── Story 1 → Developer → Peer Review → Iteration
├── Story 2 → Developer → Peer Review → Iteration  
├── Story 3 → Developer → Peer Review → Iteration
└── Epic Review → Holistic Validation → Final Approval
```

## EPIC TEMPLATE

```markdown
# [Epic Name] - Multi-Story Implementation

## EPIC OVERVIEW
[High-level description of the epic goal]

## STORIES IN THIS EPIC
1. **Story 1**: [Brief description]
2. **Story 2**: [Brief description]
3. **Story 3**: [Brief description]

## EPIC SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] All individual stories approved
- [ ] Integration between stories verified
- [ ] No regressions across the system
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained
- [ ] All platforms functioning

## IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE

### Phase 1: Story Implementation
Each story follows the ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_PROCESS.md

### Phase 2: Epic Integration Review
After all stories pass individual review:
1. Test cross-story interactions
2. Verify epic-level requirements
3. Check for system-wide regressions
4. Validate performance impact

### Phase 3: Final Epic Approval
Epic is complete when:
- All stories individually approved
- Integration tests pass
- Epic-level criteria met
```

## EXAMPLE: PLATFORM CONSOLIDATION EPIC

```markdown
# Platform Consolidation Epic

## STORIES
1. **Platform Abstraction Layer**: Create utils/platform.js
2. **Migration to Aliases**: Convert all imports to @platform
3. **Tool Configuration**: Update ESLint, Webpack, Metro, Babel
4. **Validation Suite**: Create automated verification scripts

## STORY SEQUENCING

### Story 1: Platform Abstraction Layer
**Developer implements** → **Peer Review validates**
- Must create working abstraction
- All Platform.OS removed
- Tests pass

### Story 2: Migration to Aliases  
**Developer implements** → **Peer Review validates**
- All files use @platform
- Zero relative imports
- Builds succeed

### Story 3: Tool Configuration
**Developer implements** → **Peer Review validates**
- ESLint recognizes aliases
- All bundlers configured
- Deploy script updated

### Story 4: Validation Suite
**Developer implements** → **Peer Review validates**
- Automated checks work
- CI/CD integration ready
- Documentation complete

### Epic Review: Full Platform Consolidation
**Integration Validation**:
- All stories work together
- No Platform.OS anywhere
- All platforms build
- Performance unchanged
- Zero regressions
```

## ROLES IN EPIC REVIEW

### Epic Owner (PM/Lead)
- Defines epic scope and stories
- Sets success criteria
- Manages story sequencing
- Performs final epic review

### Story Developers
- Implement individual stories
- Follow ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_PROCESS
- Coordinate on integration points

### Story Reviewers
- Validate individual stories
- Flag integration concerns
- Ensure no regressions

### Epic Reviewer
- Validates epic-level success
- Tests story integration
- Confirms holistic requirements

## EPIC REVIEW CHECKLIST

```markdown
## Epic Final Review

### Story Completion
- [ ] Story 1: APPROVED
- [ ] Story 2: APPROVED
- [ ] Story 3: APPROVED
- [ ] Story N: APPROVED

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Stories work together
- [ ] No conflicts between implementations
- [ ] Shared resources properly managed
- [ ] Data flow validated

### System Validation
- [ ] All platforms tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Security review passed

### Documentation
- [ ] Technical docs updated
- [ ] Release notes prepared
- [ ] Migration guide created
- [ ] Team trained

### Deployment Ready
- [ ] Deploy script passes
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Success metrics defined
```

## COMMON EPIC PATTERNS

### Sequential Epic
Stories must be completed in order:
```
Story 1 (Foundation) → Story 2 (Build) → Story 3 (Polish)
```

### Parallel Epic  
Stories can be developed simultaneously:
```
Story 1 ─┐
Story 2 ─┼→ Integration → Epic Complete
Story 3 ─┘
```

### Iterative Epic
Stories refine each other:
```
Story 1 → Review → Story 2 → Review → Story 1 Update → Final
```

## AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Epic Validation Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/validate-epic.sh

echo "=== EPIC VALIDATION ==="

# Check all story validations pass
./scripts/validate-story-1.sh || exit 1
./scripts/validate-story-2.sh || exit 1
./scripts/validate-story-3.sh || exit 1

# Check integration
./scripts/validate-integration.sh || exit 1

# Check performance
./scripts/validate-performance.sh || exit 1

echo "✅ EPIC VALIDATED"
```

## WHEN TO USE EPIC PROCESS

### Good Candidates
- Platform migrations
- Major feature additions
- Architecture changes
- Performance optimizations
- Security implementations

### Break Into Stories When
- Implementation > 1 day
- Multiple components affected
- Different skill sets needed
- Risk isolation required
- Parallel development possible
