3. Increase coverage by ≥10%
4. No regressions in existing functionality
5. ESLint passes with 0 errors

**Developer Role Context**:

npm test -- --coverage
npm run lint
```

## Success Metrics

### Must Achieve (for A Rating):
- ✅ Reliability: 0 bugs
- ✅ Security: 0 vulnerabilities (already achieved)
- ✅ Maintainability: <5% duplication
- ✅ Coverage: >80%
- ✅ Security Hotspots: 0 unreviewed

### Quality Gates per Story:
- Each story MUST increase coverage by ≥10%
- Each story MUST have all tests passing
- Each story MUST pass peer review
- Each story MUST not introduce new issues

## Adversarial Review Process Integration

### For Each Story:
1. **Project Manager** launches Developer Task with story requirements
2. **Developer Task** implements with focus on:
   - Meeting ALL requirements
   - Writing comprehensive tests
   - Increasing coverage by ≥10%
3. **Peer Reviewer Task** validates:
   - Coverage metrics improved
   - All requirements met
   - No regressions
   - Tests are meaningful
4. **Iteration** until approved

### Key Review Points:
- Coverage MUST increase (verify with numbers)
- Tests MUST be meaningful (not padding)
- Component usage MUST be traced
- Build MUST succeed on all platforms
- ESLint MUST pass

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers:
1. **Test Flakiness**: Fix flaky tests before adding new ones
2. **Coverage Tools**: Ensure coverage reporting works correctly
3. **Time Constraints**: Prioritize P0/P1 items
4. **Dependency Issues**: Update test dependencies first

### Contingency Plans:
- If coverage target too ambitious: Focus on critical paths first
- If bugs resurface: Add regression tests immediately
- If security hotspots complex: Get security review help
- If refactoring breaks things: Use feature flags

## Tracking Progress

### Daily Metrics:
```bash
# Check current metrics
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SONAR_TOKEN" \
  "https://sonarcloud.io/api/measures/component?component=ajstack22_manylla&metricKeys=bugs,coverage,security_hotspots"
```

### Weekly Reviews:
- Coverage delta
- Bugs fixed vs introduced
- Security hotspots reviewed
- Code smells reduced

## Notes for Adversarial Review Process

### Developer Task Prompts Should Include:
1. Specific SonarQube metrics to improve
2. Coverage targets (before/after)
3. Files to focus on
4. Test requirements
5. Edge cases to consider

### Peer Reviewer Must Verify:
1. Run `npm test -- --coverage` and check delta
2. Run `npm run lint` with 0 errors
3. Check SonarQube metrics improved
4. Verify no regressions
5. Confirm tests are meaningful

### Success = A Rating in All Categories

This roadmap provides clear, measurable stories that work perfectly with the Adversarial Review Process. Each story has specific requirements that can be validated independently by the Peer Reviewer Task instance.
