  need you to:\
  \
  Use the task tool with the PM:\
  Create a story/full production prompt
  for:\
  \
  creating a mechanism to upload and save a
  photo to a user profile\
  \
  Make sure that the developer knows that
  this will follow the adversarial peer
  review process.\
  \
  Once the results come back from the PM
  create a new instance of the task tool
  utilizing the developer profile to
  actually implement the extremely detailed
  and follow the bouncing dot story that
  was created\
  \
  The developer will submit a report
  consistent with the one documented in teh
  review process.\
  \
  When the results come back you are to
  submit the report to the task tool with
  the peer review profile loaded into
  context, facilitate back and forth
  between the developer and the PM until the
  the codebase passes the peer review
  process.\
  \
  Then draft an extremely brief summary of
  what was changed and display it to the
  user, update teh Release Notes that will
  be used later to submit to github. Submit
  to local and start the web service on
  3000 for validation.
