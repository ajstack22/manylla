## Adversarial Review Process

When executing any story:
1. **Developer** implements the requirements
2. **Peer Reviewer** conducts rigorous validation
3. **Platform Experts** verify platform-specific functionality
4. **Specialist Roles** review their domain areas
5. Process continues until Peer Reviewer gives FULL APPROVAL

Each role should act adversarially:
- Developer tries to complete efficiently
- Reviewer tries to find ANY reason to reject
- Platform experts verify no regressions
- Specialists ensure domain requirements met
