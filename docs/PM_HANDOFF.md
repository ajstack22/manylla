# PM Handoff Document - Manylla Project

## Executive Summary
This document provides a complete handoff of PM responsibilities for the Manylla project. The codebase has been successfully consolidated to a unified JavaScript architecture, the header feature is complete, and comprehensive working agreements are in place. Two modal consistency sessions are ready for implementation.

## Project Status Overview

### âœ… Completed Work
1. **File Consolidation** - COMPLETE
   - Zero TypeScript files remain
   - Zero platform-specific files
   - Unified .js components with Platform.select()
   - Build succeeds

2. **Header Implementation** - COMPLETE
   - Fixed sticky header with profile transition
   - Scroll-based animations working
   - Profile photo/name replaces "manylla" on scroll
   - Primary color updated to #A08670 throughout

3. **Working Agreements** - DOCUMENTED
   - Created `/docs/WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md`
   - Embedded in all prompt packs
   - Adversarial review process defined
   - Non-negotiable standards established

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
1. **Modal Consistency Review**
   - Session 1 prompt pack ready: `/docs/prompts/modal-consistency-session-1.md`
   - Session 2 prompt pack ready: `/docs/prompts/modal-consistency-session-2.md`
   - Awaiting developer implementation

### ðŸ“‹ Upcoming Work
1. Modal consistency implementation (2 sessions)
2. Performance optimization review
3. Mobile platform testing
4. Production deployment preparation

## Critical Technical Context

### Architecture Decisions
- **Unified Codebase**: Single .js files with Platform.select() - NO exceptions
- **No TypeScript**: This is a JavaScript project
- **React Native Web**: Not Material-UI directly
- **Build Output**: `web/build/` (NOT `build/`)
- **Primary Color**: #A08670 (manila brown) - was #8B7355, now updated everywhere

```

### Development Standards Enforcement

#### Verification Commands (MUST return 0)
```bash
find src -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | wc -l      # TypeScript check
find src -name "*.native.*" -o -name "*.web.*" | wc -l  # Platform files check
```

#### Build Validation
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 npm run build:web
```

#### Deployment (ONLY method)
```bash
./scripts/deploy-qual.sh
```

## Prompt Pack Management

### Current Prompt Packs Status
1. **Header Implementation** - COMPLETE
   - Both sessions implemented
   - Profile transition working
   - Color updated to #A08670

2. **File Consolidation** - COMPLETE
   - All TypeScript removed
   - All platform files consolidated
   - Passed adversarial review

3. **Modal Consistency** - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
   - Session 1: Core modals standardization
   - Session 2: Sharing & secondary modals
   - Working agreements embedded

### Prompt Pack Creation Guidelines
- Include WORKING_AGREEMENTS reference at top
- Show WRONG patterns explicitly
- Include verification commands
- Set appropriate severity level
- Add adversarial review warnings for critical work

## Adversarial Review Process

### Review Criteria
1. **Compliance Check**: Verification commands must return 0
2. **Functional Testing**: All features on all platforms
3. **Code Quality**: Follows all patterns exactly
4. **Performance**: 60fps, no layout shifts

### Review Outcomes
- **PASS**: All criteria met
- **FAIL**: Any criterion not met (no partial credit)

## Key Relationships & Context

### Design Philosophy
- **Manila Envelope Aesthetic**: Warm browns (#A08670), paper-like feel
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Client-side encryption only
- **Unified Experience**: Same behavior across all platforms

### Recent Issues Resolved
1. **Duplicate App.js/App.tsx**: Consolidated to single App.js
2. **Header Not Fixed**: Now properly sticky with z-index
3. **Profile Transition**: Smooth fade between states
4. **Column Layout**: Responsive with dynamic state
5. **Primary Color**: Updated from #8B7355 to #A08670

## Handoff Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Review `/docs/WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md` thoroughly
2. Assign modal consistency sessions to developers
3. Monitor compliance with verification commands
4. Enforce adversarial review process

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Developers creating TypeScript files
  - **Mitigation**: Run verification commands before any PR
  
- **Risk**: Platform-specific files creeping back
  - **Mitigation**: Automated checks in deploy script
  
- **Risk**: Color inconsistency
  - **Mitigation**: #A08670 documented everywhere

### Success Metrics
- Zero TypeScript files
- Zero platform-specific files
- All modals following manila aesthetic
- 60fps performance
- Build succeeds without warnings

## Communication Templates

### For Developers Starting Work
```
Please review:
1. /docs/WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md (MANDATORY)
2. Your assigned prompt pack in /docs/prompts/
3. Run verification commands before starting

Remember:
- NO TypeScript (.js only)
- NO platform files (use Platform.select())
- Primary color is #A08670
- Build output is web/build/
```

### For Adversarial Review
```
ADVERSARIAL REVIEW CHECKLIST:
â–¡ find src -name "*.tsx" returns 0
â–¡ find src -name "*.native.*" returns 0
â–¡ npm run build:web succeeds
â–¡ All modals tested on web
â–¡ Colors match #A08670 primary
â–¡ No regressions identified

VERDICT: [PASS/FAIL]
```

## Continuity Prompt for New Session

When starting a new conversation, use this prompt:

```markdown
I'm taking over PM responsibilities for the Manylla project. Please review the following context:

PROJECT: Manylla - React Native Web app for special needs information management
ARCHITECTURE: Unified JavaScript codebase (.js only, NO TypeScript)
PRIMARY COLOR: #A08670 (manila brown)
BUILD: web/build/ directory (not build/)

COMPLETED:
- File consolidation (zero .tsx, zero .native.* files)
- Header with profile transition on scroll
- Working agreements documented

IN PROGRESS:
- Modal consistency review (2 sessions ready in /docs/prompts/)

KEY DOCS:
- /docs/WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md (critical standards)
- /docs/PM_HANDOFF.md (this handoff)
- /docs/prompts/ (prompt packs)

VERIFICATION (must return 0):
find src -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | wc -l
find src -name "*.native.*" -o -name "*.web.*" | wc -l

Please acknowledge this context and help me continue managing the modal consistency implementation and any other development work. The next priority is getting developers to implement the modal consistency sessions while maintaining our strict unified architecture standards.
```

## Final Notes

### What Went Well
- Successfully consolidated 40+ files to unified architecture
- Established clear working agreements
- Created reusable prompt pack templates
- Implemented smooth header transitions
- Updated colors consistently

### Lessons Learned
- Embed standards directly in prompt packs
- Use adversarial review warnings for critical work
- Verify architecture compliance before functional work
- Document color values everywhere to prevent confusion
- Platform.select() is the only acceptable pattern

### PM Philosophy Applied
- Clear, non-negotiable standards
- Brutal honesty in reviews
- No partial credit approach
- Documentation as enforcement tool
- Verification before implementation
