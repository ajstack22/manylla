# Phase 1 Security Hardening - Completion Report
## Date: September 6, 2025

## Executive Summary
Phase 1 of the Manylla Security Hardening Master Plan has been successfully completed. All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed, including encrypted share storage, comprehensive input validation, and multi-layer rate limiting.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1.1: Fixed Unencrypted Share Storage ✅
**Previous Issue**: Medical data was stored in plaintext in localStorage
**Solution Implemented**:
- Migrated to V2 share format with proper encryption
- Share data now encrypted using XSalsa20-Poly1305 (TweetNaCl)
- Encryption key stored in URL fragment (never sent to server)
- Storage location: `manylla_shares_v2` in localStorage
- URL format: `/share/[token]#[key]`

**Key Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Sharing/ShareDialogOptimized.tsx` - Creates encrypted shares
- `src/components/Sharing/SharedView.tsx` - Decrypts and displays shares
- `public/index.html` - Added hash fragment capture script
- `src/App.tsx` - Enhanced URL parsing for share tokens

### Task 1.2: Added Input Validation to All API Endpoints ✅
**Previous Issue**: No validation on API inputs, SQL injection risk
**Solution Implemented**:
- Created centralized `api/utils/validation.php`
- Validates sync_id (32 hex chars)
- Validates device_id (32 hex chars)  
- Validates invite codes (XXXX-XXXX format)
- Applied to all sync endpoints

**Files Updated**:
- `api/sync/push_timestamp.php`
- `api/sync/pull_timestamp.php`
- `api/sync/join_timestamp.php`
- `api/sync/create_invite.php`
- `api/sync/validate_invite.php`
- `api/sync/use_invite.php`

### Task 1.3: Implemented Client-Side Rate Limiting ✅
**Previous Issue**: No protection against rapid API calls
**Solution Implemented**:
- 200ms minimum interval between requests
- `enforceRateLimit()` method in sync service
- `makeRequest()` wrapper for all API calls
- Console logging for debugging

**File Modified**:
- `src/services/sync/manyllaMinimalSyncService.js`

### Task 1.4: Implemented Server-Side Rate Limiting ✅
**Previous Issue**: No server-side protection against abuse
**Solution Implemented**:
- Created comprehensive `api/utils/rate-limiter.php`
- IP-based limiting: 120 requests/minute
- Device-based limiting: 60 requests/minute
- New device protection: 60-second delay
- Data reduction protection: Blocks >50% data loss
- Suspicious activity monitoring

**Protection Layers**:
1. IP rate limiting
2. Device rate limiting
3. New device cooldown
4. Data loss prevention
5. Rapid device switching detection

## Technical Improvements

### Share URL Routing
- Fixed Apache rewrite rules for SPA routing
- Added explicit handling for `/share/` and `/sync/` routes
- Created environment-specific .htaccess files (qual/prod)

### Hash Fragment Preservation
- Implemented early hash capture before React initialization
- Prevents loss of encryption keys during client-side routing
- Stores data in `window.__earlyShareData`

### Code Cleanup
- Removed all V1 share format support
- Eliminated backward compatibility code
- Simplified SharedView component
- Removed unused ShareDialog variants

## Security Posture Improvements

### Before Phase 1
- Medical data stored in plaintext
- No input validation
- No rate limiting
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Share keys visible in localStorage

### After Phase 1
- All medical data encrypted at rest
- Comprehensive input validation
- Multi-layer rate limiting
- SQL injection prevention
- Zero-knowledge share architecture

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Deployed to qual environment (https://manylla.com/qual)
- ✅ All features tested and working
- ✅ Share URLs functioning correctly
- ✅ Rate limiting active and tested

## Known Issues Resolved
1. Share URL 404 errors - Fixed with .htaccess rules
2. Hash fragment loss - Fixed with early capture script
3. localStorage key mismatch - Migrated to V2 format
4. Missing encryption keys - Now properly passed via URL fragment

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Replace emulated prepared statements with real ones
- Implement error message sanitization
- Add compression for large payloads
- Connect invite system to backend

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Create encrypted share
- [x] Access share via URL with key
- [x] Verify expiration enforcement
- [x] Test rate limiting (client)
- [x] Test rate limiting (server)
- [x] Validate API input rejection
- [x] Confirm no plaintext data in localStorage

## Files to Review
1. `src/components/Sharing/ShareDialogOptimized.tsx`
2. `src/components/Sharing/SharedView.tsx`
3. `src/services/sync/manyllaMinimalSyncService.js`
4. `api/utils/rate-limiter.php`
5. `api/utils/validation.php`

## Conclusion
Phase 1 has successfully addressed all critical security vulnerabilities in Manylla. The application now implements industry-standard encryption, comprehensive validation, and robust rate limiting. The system is ready for Phase 2 improvements.
