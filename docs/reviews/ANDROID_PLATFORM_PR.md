# Pull Request: Android Platform Support

## PR Title
feat: Android platform support with RN 0.81.1 compatibility

## Branch
`feature/android-platform-setup`

## Summary
Implements Android platform support for Manylla app, resolving Java version conflicts and library incompatibilities to enable successful Android builds.

## Changes Made

### üîß Build Configuration
- **Updated** `android/build.gradle` - SDK 35, Kotlin 2.1.20, NDK 27.1.12297006
- **Enhanced** `android/gradle.properties` - 8GB memory, parallel builds, caching enabled
- **Fixed** Java 17 enforcement (system defaulted to Java 24)

### üì¶ Dependencies
- **Upgraded** `react-native-safe-area-context` from 4.14.0 ‚Üí 5.6.1
  - Resolves Yoga API incompatibility with RN 0.81.1
  - Fixes compilation error: `no member named 'unit'`

### üõ†Ô∏è Build Scripts
Created helper scripts in `scripts/android/`:
- `run-android.sh` - Enforces Java 17, launches app with Metro
- `build-android.sh` - Generates debug/release APKs and AABs
- `clean-android.sh` - Cleans build artifacts and caches

### üìù Documentation
- Added `ANDROID_SETUP_ACTUAL_STATUS.md` - Honest status report
- Added `ANDROID_LIBRARY_FIX.md` - Library compatibility solution
- Updated `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` - Version 2025.09.11.14

## Problem Solved
1. ‚úÖ Java 24 incompatibility - Now enforces Java 17
2. ‚úÖ CMake build failures - Clean build now passes
3. ‚úÖ Library incompatibility - Updated to compatible version
4. ‚úÖ Missing Android support - APK builds successfully

## Testing Performed

### Build Verification
```bash
# Clean build test
cd android && ./gradlew clean
# Result: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s

# Debug APK build
./gradlew assembleDebug  
# Result: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 20s
# Output: 75MB APK at android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
```

### Java Version Enforcement
```bash
source scripts/android/run-android.sh --version
# Output: Using Java version: openjdk version "17.0.15"
#         ‚úÖ Java 17 verified
```

### Compatibility Testing
- [x] Gradle clean passes
- [x] Debug APK builds successfully
- [x] Java 17 properly enforced in scripts
- [x] react-native-safe-area-context v5.6.1 compatible

## Known Limitations
- Requires manual Java 17 installation (brew install openjdk@17)
- Emulator testing pending (APK built but not runtime tested)
- Physical device testing required

## Screenshots/Evidence
```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 20s
397 actionable tasks: 252 executed, 135 from cache, 10 up-to-date
```

## Checklist
- [x] Code builds without errors
- [x] Follows project conventions (no TypeScript, no .native/.web files)
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Release notes added
- [x] Scripts are executable
- [x] Java 17 enforcement tested
- [ ] Tested on Android emulator (pending)
- [ ] Tested on physical device (pending)

## Breaking Changes
None - Android support is additive only

## Dependencies
- Updated: `react-native-safe-area-context` ^4.14.0 ‚Üí ^5.6.1

## Migration Guide
For developers setting up Android:
1. Install Java 17: `brew install openjdk@17`
2. Use provided scripts in `scripts/android/`
3. Never use system Java 24 - will cause build failures

## Related Issues
- Resolves: Android platform support requirement
- Fixes: react-native-safe-area-context RN 0.81 incompatibility

## Review Focus Areas
1. **Build Scripts** - Java 17 enforcement approach
2. **Gradle Configuration** - Memory and optimization settings
3. **Library Update** - safe-area-context major version bump
4. **Documentation** - Accuracy of status reports

## Deploy Instructions
```bash
# After merge:
1. npm install  # Get updated dependencies
2. cd android && ./gradlew clean
3. ./scripts/android/run-android.sh  # Test on emulator
4. ./scripts/android/build-android.sh release  # For production
```

## Performance Impact
- Build time: ~1m 20s for debug APK
- APK size: 75MB (debug, unoptimized)
- Memory usage: 8GB allocated for Gradle

## Security Considerations
- No credentials or keys in scripts
- Java 17 enforced for security updates
- Standard Android permissions in manifest

## Commit History
```
e1a6f47 feat: Android platform setup (partial - library incompatibility)
[current] fix: Update safe-area-context for RN 0.81 compatibility
```

## Additional Context
This implementation follows patterns from StackMap's Android setup, particularly:
- Java version enforcement in scripts
- Library compatibility resolution approach
- Build optimization settings

The honest status reports (ANDROID_SETUP_ACTUAL_STATUS.md) document the real state of the implementation, including what worked and what didn't, providing transparency for future debugging.

**Ready for Review** ‚úÖ

Android platform support is now functional with successful APK generation. The build system is properly configured, dependencies are compatible, and helper scripts ensure consistent Java 17 usage.
