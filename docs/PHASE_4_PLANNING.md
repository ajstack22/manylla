## Phase 4 Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Secure Invite System Backend** - Enable device pairing with enhanced security
2. **Advanced Conflict Resolution** - Implement secure merge strategies
3. **Compression & Versioning** - Optimize data transfer and storage
4. **Comprehensive Audit Logging** - Track all security-relevant events
5. **Mobile API Preparation** - Ensure APIs are ready for iOS/Android apps

### Timeline
- **Estimated Duration**: 4-5 days
- **Target Start**: September 8, 2025
- **Target Completion**: September 13, 2025

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Task 4.1: Secure Invite System Backend
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 1 day

#### Requirements
- Collision-resistant invite code generation
- Time-limited invite codes (expire after 24 hours)
- Single-use enforcement
- Rate limiting on invite creation
- Audit trail for invite usage

#### Implementation Steps
1. Update `create_invite.php` with secure code generation
2. Add invite validation to `join_timestamp.php`
3. Implement invite expiration cleanup
4. Add rate limiting (10 invites per hour)
5. Create audit logging for invite events

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Invite codes are unique (no collisions in 10,000 attempts)
- [ ] Expired invites cannot be used
- [ ] Used invites cannot be reused
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Audit log captures all invite events

### Task 4.2: Advanced Conflict Resolution
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Estimated Time**: 1 day

#### Requirements
- Detect conflicting changes from multiple devices
- Implement secure merge strategies
- Preserve data integrity during conflicts
- Provide conflict history
- Zero-knowledge maintained during resolution

#### Implementation Steps
1. Add conflict detection to `sync_push.php`
2. Implement three-way merge algorithm
3. Create conflict resolution endpoint
4. Add conflict history tracking
5. Update frontend to handle conflicts

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Conflicts detected when same data modified
- [ ] Merge preserves all non-conflicting changes
- [ ] User can choose resolution strategy
- [ ] Conflict history is maintained
- [ ] Zero-knowledge preserved

### Task 4.3: Compression & Versioning
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Estimated Time**: 1 day

#### Requirements
- Gzip compression for large payloads
- Semantic versioning for data schema
- Migration support for schema changes
- Backward compatibility for 2 versions
- Compression statistics tracking

#### Implementation Steps
1. Add gzip compression to sync endpoints
2. Implement version field in sync_data
3. Create migration system
4. Add version negotiation to handshake
5. Track compression ratios

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Large payloads compressed automatically
- [ ] Version negotiation works
- [ ] Old clients can still sync (2 versions back)
- [ ] Compression ratio > 50% for typical data
- [ ] Migration scripts work correctly

### Task 4.4: Comprehensive Audit Logging
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 1 day

#### Requirements
- Log all security-relevant events
- Tamper-resistant log storage
- Log rotation and archival
- Query interface for logs
- GDPR-compliant retention

#### Implementation Steps
1. Enhance audit_log table structure
2. Add logging to all endpoints
3. Implement log rotation (30-day retention)
4. Create admin query interface
5. Add log integrity checks

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] All API calls logged
- [ ] Share creation/access logged
- [ ] Sync events logged
- [ ] Logs rotate after 30 days
- [ ] Query interface works

### Task 4.5: Mobile API Preparation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 1 day

#### Requirements
- RESTful API documentation
- API versioning strategy
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Token-based authentication ready
- API rate limiting per device

#### Implementation Steps
1. Document all API endpoints (OpenAPI/Swagger)
2. Add API version headers
3. Optimize payloads for mobile
4. Prepare auth token system (not user accounts)
5. Implement device-specific rate limits

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Version headers work
- [ ] Mobile payload optimizations verified
- [ ] Auth token system ready (not implemented)
- [ ] Rate limiting per device works

## Success Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] All endpoints have <200ms response time
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for API
- [ ] Zero data loss during conflicts
- [ ] 100% audit coverage for security events
- [ ] Mobile-ready API documentation

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Zero-knowledge encryption maintained
- [ ] No plaintext data in logs
- [ ] Invite codes cryptographically secure
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Audit trail tamper-resistant

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] 50%+ compression for large payloads
- [ ] Conflict resolution < 500ms
- [ ] Invite generation < 100ms
- [ ] Log queries < 1 second
- [ ] Mobile API optimized for 3G

## Migration Notes

### From Phase 3 to Phase 4
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- New endpoints added alongside existing
- Database schema additions only (no modifications)
- Frontend updates optional (backward compatible)

### Database Changes
```sql
-- New tables for Phase 4
ALTER TABLE sync_data ADD COLUMN schema_version INT DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE sync_data ADD COLUMN compression_ratio FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE audit_log ADD COLUMN integrity_hash VARCHAR(64);
ALTER TABLE invite_codes ADD COLUMN created_by_ip VARCHAR(45);
```

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Risks
1. **Invite Code Collisions** - Mitigated by collision detection
2. **Conflict Resolution Data Loss** - Mitigated by comprehensive testing
3. **Log Storage Growth** - Mitigated by rotation policy
4. **Mobile API Breaking Changes** - Mitigated by versioning
5. **Compression CPU Overhead** - Mitigated by selective compression

### Rollback Plan
- Each task can be rolled back independently
- Database changes are additive (no destructive changes)
- API versioning allows gradual migration
- Previous version remains deployed on production

## Next Steps After Phase 4

### Phase 5: Mobile App Development
- React Native implementation
- iOS and Android apps
- Biometric authentication
- Offline-first architecture
- Push notifications

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- Multi-child profiles
- Provider portal
- Document attachments
- Video summaries
- AI-assisted insights

## Notes for Implementation

### For LLM Developers
When implementing Phase 4:
1. Read the entire SECURITY_HARDENING_MASTER_PLAN.md first
2. Verify Phase 3 is fully deployed and working
3. Create a new branch for Phase 4 work
4. Test each task independently before integration
5. Update this document with actual completion dates
6. Document any deviations or issues encountered

### Testing Environment
- Use https://manylla.com/qual/ for testing
- Database: stachblx_manylla_sync_qual
- SSH: `ssh -p 21098 stachblx@manylla.com`
- Monitor logs at ~/logs/manylla.com/

### Important Reminders
- Maintain zero-knowledge encryption throughout
- No user accounts or personal information required
- All changes must be backward compatible
- Document all API changes thoroughly
- Test on actual mobile devices before declaring complete
