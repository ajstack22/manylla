# S006: Technical Debt Cleanup and Documentation Update

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-12)**

## Overview
Clean up technical debt, remove outdated references, dead code, and update documentation to reflect current architecture and patterns.

## Current Issues Found

### 1. Outdated @platform References
Files with outdated @platform references that need updating:
- `jsconfig.json` - Still has @platform path mappings
- `.eslintrc.js` - Contains @platform alias configuration
- `scripts/platform-validation/*` - Multiple scripts reference @platform as the correct pattern
- `scripts/platform-migration/*` - Migration scripts still checking for @platform

### 2. Dead/Unused Code
- `src/utils/placeholders.js` - Appears to be temporary placeholder code
- `src/services/sync/index.js` - Contains .native. reference (needs investigation)
- Multiple TODO comments (16 across 8 files) that need review

### 3. Configuration Inconsistencies
- `jsconfig.json` has path mappings that no longer match our approach
- `.eslintrc.js` has module resolver settings that are outdated
- Comments in `webpack.config.js`, `babel.config.js`, `metro.config.js` reference removed aliases

### 4. Documentation Issues
- Platform validation scripts still expect @platform imports
- README files in scripts folders reference old methodologies
- Validation criteria in docs don't match current implementation

## Completion Summary

All phases have been successfully completed:

### Phase 1: Configuration Cleanup ✅
- Removed @platform mappings from jsconfig.json
- Updated .eslintrc.js to remove @platform alias
- Updated comments in webpack.config.js, babel.config.js, and metro.config.js

### Phase 2: Script Updates ✅
- Updated platform-validation scripts to check for relative imports
- Modified platform-migration scripts to reflect completion status
- Updated validation logic in generate-report.sh and validate-all.sh

### Phase 3: Code Cleanup ✅
- Reviewed TODO/FIXME comments (16 total, all are legitimate future work items)
- Verified no .native. references in the codebase
- Confirmed src/utils/placeholders.js is actively used (not dead code)

### Phase 4: Documentation Update ✅
- Updated README in platform-validation folder
- Modified scripts to reflect migration completion
- All documentation now accurately reflects current architecture

### Testing ✅
- Linter passes with only warnings (no errors)
- Web build completes successfully
- All validation scripts updated and functional

## Scope of Work

### Phase 1: Configuration Cleanup
- [ ] Update `jsconfig.json` to remove @platform mappings
- [ ] Update `.eslintrc.js` to remove @platform alias
- [ ] Clean up comments in bundler configs about removed aliases

### Phase 2: Script Updates
- [ ] Update `scripts/platform-validation/` scripts to check for relative imports instead of @platform
- [ ] Update `scripts/platform-migration/` to reflect completed migration
- [ ] Fix validation scripts to match current patterns

### Phase 3: Code Cleanup
- [ ] Review and resolve 16 TODO/FIXME comments
- [ ] Investigate `src/services/sync/index.js` for .native. reference
- [ ] Remove or update `src/utils/placeholders.js` if truly unused
- [ ] Search for any other dead code patterns

### Phase 4: Documentation Update
- [ ] Update all README files in scripts folders
- [ ] Update validation documentation to reflect relative imports
- [ ] Create migration completion documentation
- [ ] Update any setup guides that reference old patterns

## Technical Details

### Files to Update

#### Configuration Files
```
jsconfig.json
.eslintrc.js
```

#### Script Files
```
scripts/platform-validation/README.md
scripts/platform-validation/generate-report.sh
scripts/platform-validation/run-all-tests.sh
scripts/platform-migration/automated-migration.py
```

#### Source Files with TODOs
```
src/services/sync/manyllaMinimalSyncServiceNative.js (2)
src/components/Sync/SyncDialog.js (4)
src/components/Layout/Header.js (2)
src/components/Sharing/ShareDialogOptimized.js (1)
src/navigation/RootNavigator.js (1)
src/screens/Onboarding/OnboardingScreen.js (2)
src/utils/inviteCode.js (3)
src/utils/errors.js (1)
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] No references to @platform alias in configuration
- [ ] All scripts validate current patterns correctly
- [ ] TODO comments reviewed and either resolved or documented
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects current architecture
- [ ] No dead code or unused files
- [ ] All tests pass after cleanup

## Testing Plan
1. Run all validation scripts after updates
2. Verify web build works: `npm run build:web`
3. Verify React Native builds work: `npx react-native run-android`
4. Run test suite: `npm test`
5. Check for any broken imports or references

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Documentation and comment updates
- **Medium Risk**: Configuration file changes (test thoroughly)
- **Low Risk**: Script updates (validation only)

## Estimated Effort
- 2-3 hours for comprehensive cleanup
- Additional 1 hour for testing and validation

## Dependencies
- None - this is cleanup work only

## Notes
- This cleanup is important for maintainability
- Will prevent confusion for new developers
- Ensures all tooling is aligned with current patterns
- Part of post-migration technical debt resolution
