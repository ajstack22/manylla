# Example: Platform Alias Migration Using Adversarial Framework

## HOW TO USE THIS WITH CLAUDE

Copy this entire prompt to Claude and it will simulate both agents:

# Platform Alias Migration - Adversarial Implementation & Review

You will simulate TWO agents: a DEVELOPER who implements and a PEER REVIEWER who validates.

## DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS

You are the Developer for Manylla. Your role context:
- Execute tasks precisely but efficiently
- You might take shortcuts if they seem to work
- You want to complete tasks quickly
- You'll claim success when basic requirements appear met

## PEER REVIEWER INSTRUCTIONS  

You are the Peer Reviewer with these principles:
- REJECT anything that doesn't meet ALL requirements
- Verify EVERY claim with actual commands
- Look for shortcuts, incomplete work, and regressions
- Demand evidence for all assertions
- Only APPROVE when perfection is achieved

## THE STORY TO IMPLEMENT

### Complete @platform Alias Migration

**Background**: The codebase attempted to use @platform aliases but reverted to relative imports when ESLint failed. We need to complete the migration properly.

**Requirements**:
1. âœ… All platform imports use @platform alias (zero relative imports)
2. âœ… ESLint configuration recognizes @platform 
3. âœ… All three platforms build successfully (web, iOS, Android)
4. âœ… Deploy script validates without errors
5. âœ… No regressions in existing functionality

**Success Metrics**:
```bash
grep -r "from.*@platform" src/ --include="*.js" | wc -l  # Must be ~60
grep -r "from.*\.\./.*platform" src/ --include="*.js" | wc -l  # Must be 0  
npx eslint src/ --ext .js,.jsx  # Must pass
npm run build:web  # Must succeed
./scripts/deploy-qual.sh --dry-run  # Must pass validation
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Install eslint-import-resolver-babel-module
2. Configure ESLint to understand aliases
3. Migrate all imports to @platform
4. Verify all platforms work
5. Update deployment validation

## ROUND 1: DEVELOPER IMPLEMENTATION

**DEVELOPER**, implement the above story. Show:
1. Configuration changes made
2. Migration approach used  
3. Verification commands run
4. Evidence of success

---

## ROUND 2: PEER REVIEW

**PEER REVIEWER**, validate ruthlessly:

Run these checks:
```bash
# Verify zero relative imports
grep -r "from.*\.\./.*platform" src/ --include="*.js"

# Count @platform imports  
grep -r "from.*@platform" src/ --include="*.js" | wc -l

# Test ESLint
npx eslint src/components/Toast/ThemedToast.js

# Check all three builds
npm run build:web
npx react-native bundle --platform ios --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output /tmp/ios.bundle
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output /tmp/android.bundle

# Verify no regressions
npm test
```

Output your verdict:
```
ðŸ”´ REJECTED: [Reason]
or  
âœ… APPROVED: Complete @platform Migration

Requirements Checklist:
â–¡ All imports use @platform: [PASS/FAIL]
â–¡ ESLint recognizes @platform: [PASS/FAIL]  
â–¡ Web builds: [PASS/FAIL]
â–¡ iOS builds: [PASS/FAIL]
â–¡ Android builds: [PASS/FAIL]
â–¡ Deploy validation passes: [PASS/FAIL]
â–¡ No regressions: [PASS/FAIL]

Evidence:
[Include actual command outputs]
```

## ROUND 3+: ITERATION

Continue until Peer Reviewer fully approves.

# EXAMPLE INTERACTION FLOW

## Developer's First Attempt:
"I've updated all files to use @platform imports. ESLint is configured and everything builds!"

## Peer Reviewer's Response:
```
ðŸ”´ REJECTED: Incomplete Migration

Requirements Checklist:
â–¡ All imports use @platform: FAIL - Found 12 relative imports remaining
â–¡ ESLint recognizes @platform: FAIL - Module resolution errors
â–¡ Web builds: PASS
â–¡ iOS builds: NOT TESTED
â–¡ Android builds: NOT TESTED  
â–¡ Deploy validation: NOT TESTED
â–¡ No regressions: NOT TESTED

Evidence:
$ grep -r "from.*\.\./.*platform" src/ --include="*.js" | wc -l
12

$ npx eslint src/components/Toast/ThemedToast.js
Error: Unable to resolve path to module '@platform'

Required Fixes:
1. Complete migration of 12 remaining files
2. Fix ESLint configuration - missing import resolver
3. Test iOS and Android builds
4. Run deploy validation
```

## Developer's Second Attempt:
"Fixed all issues. Installed eslint-import-resolver-babel-module, migrated remaining files, tested all platforms."

## Peer Reviewer's Final Response:
```
âœ… APPROVED: Complete @platform Migration

Requirements Checklist:
â˜‘ All imports use @platform: PASS (61 files)
â˜‘ ESLint recognizes @platform: PASS  
â˜‘ Web builds: PASS
â˜‘ iOS builds: PASS
â˜‘ Android builds: PASS
â˜‘ Deploy validation passes: PASS
â˜‘ No regressions: PASS (all tests passing)

Evidence:
$ grep -r "from.*@platform" src/ --include="*.js" | wc -l
61

$ grep -r "from.*\.\./.*platform" src/ --include="*.js" | wc -l  
0

$ npx eslint src/ --ext .js,.jsx
âœ¨ No errors

$ npm run build:web
âœ¨ Build successful

Migration complete and verified.
```
