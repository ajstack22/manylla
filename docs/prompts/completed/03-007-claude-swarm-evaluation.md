# Evaluate Claude Swarm for Multi-Agent Orchestration

## ðŸ”µ SEVERITY: LOW - FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

**Type**: Research/Evaluation Task for Admin Role

**Goal**: Assess whether Claude Swarm could improve our development workflow by automating multi-role collaboration

## Research Context

### Tool Overview
**Claude Swarm**: https://github.com/parruda/claude-swarm
- Orchestrates multiple Claude Code instances as collaborative team
- Uses YAML configuration for agent definitions
- Enables inter-agent communication via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Supports hierarchical agent structures for complex workflows

### Current Workflow
- Manual role switching between PM, Developer, Peer Reviewer, Admin
- Sequential task execution
- Manual handoffs between roles
- Single context window shared across all roles

## Evaluation Areas

### Potential Benefits
1. **Parallel Development**
   - Multiple agents working on different prompt packs simultaneously
   - Faster overall development cycles
   - No context switching overhead

2. **Role Specialization**
   - Each agent maintains dedicated context
   - Specialized tool permissions per role
   - Cleaner separation of concerns

3. **Automated Coordination**
   - Agents communicate via MCP
   - Automatic handoffs between roles
   - Built-in task delegation

### Potential Drawbacks
1. **Complexity**
   - YAML configuration learning curve
   - MCP setup and debugging
   - More moving parts to manage

2. **Cost**
   - Multiple Claude instances = higher API usage
   - Potential for redundant work if not coordinated well

3. **Project Fit**
   - May be overkill for current project size
   - Manual system is working adequately
   - Production bugs take priority

## Research Tasks

### Task 1: Technical Feasibility
**Questions to Answer**:
- What are the setup requirements?
- How complex is the YAML configuration?
- What's the learning curve for the team?
- How does MCP work between agents?

### Task 2: Cost-Benefit Analysis
**Questions to Answer**:
- What's the API cost multiplier?
- How much time would it save?
- At what project size does it make sense?
- What's the break-even point?

### Task 3: Implementation Strategy
**Questions to Answer**:
- How would we map our roles to agents?
- What tools would each agent need?
- How would we handle prompt pack queue?
- Could we pilot with 2 agents first?

## Investigation Steps

1. **Step 1**: Review Claude Swarm Documentation
   ```bash
   # Clone and explore the repository
   git clone https://github.com/parruda/claude-swarm.git
   cd claude-swarm
   # Review examples and configuration
   ```

2. **Step 2**: Analyze Our Current Workflow
   - Document time spent on role switching
   - Identify bottlenecks in current process
   - List tasks that could run in parallel

3. **Step 3**: Create Proof of Concept
   - Design YAML config for our 4 roles
   - Estimate API costs
   - Define success metrics

## Evaluation Criteria

### Must-Have Requirements
- [ ] Setup time < 2 hours
- [ ] Clear documentation available
- [ ] Cost increase < 2x current
- [ ] Demonstrable time savings
- [ ] Team can understand and maintain

### Nice-to-Have Features
- [ ] Visual monitoring of agent activity
- [ ] Easy rollback to manual process
- [ ] Gradual adoption path
- [ ] Integration with existing tools

## Deliverables

### Research Report Should Include
- [ ] Executive summary (1 paragraph)
- [ ] Technical requirements detailed
- [ ] Cost analysis with projections
- [ ] Implementation roadmap
- [ ] Go/No-Go recommendation
- [ ] If Go: Pilot project proposal
- [ ] If No-Go: Revisit criteria (when to reconsider)

### Documentation to Create
- [ ] `/docs/research/claude-swarm-evaluation.md` - Full findings
- [ ] `/docs/architecture/multi-agent-proposal.md` - If moving forward
- [ ] Update role definitions if adopting

## Success Criteria

### Research Complete When
- [ ] All evaluation areas investigated
- [ ] Cost-benefit analysis documented
- [ ] Technical feasibility assessed
- [ ] Clear recommendation provided
- [ ] Implementation plan drafted (if proceeding)
- [ ] Team consensus achieved

### Decision Framework
**Proceed if:**
- Time savings > 30% on multi-pack work
- Setup complexity is manageable
- API costs justified by efficiency gains

**Defer if:**
- Current system meeting needs
- Too complex for current team size
- Production issues take priority

## Time Estimate
2-3 hours for initial research
1-2 days for full evaluation with POC

## Priority
LOW - Future enhancement, not blocking current work. Current manual system is functional. Focus on production bugs first.

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk**: Over-engineering solution for simple problem
  - **Mitigation**: Start with pilot, measure actual benefits
- **Risk**: High API costs without proportional benefit
  - **Mitigation**: Set cost ceiling, monitor usage closely
- **Risk**: Team confusion with new tooling
  - **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout, maintain manual fallback

## Next Steps
1. Admin reviews this evaluation request
2. If approved, Admin conducts research
3. Team reviews findings together
4. Make go/no-go decision
5. If go: Create implementation prompt pack
6. If no-go: Revisit in Phase 4

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Follow WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md strictly
- Update documentation as part of the work, not after
- Run ALL validation commands before marking complete
