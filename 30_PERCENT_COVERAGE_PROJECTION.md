# Projection: Reaching 30% Test Coverage

## Current State
- **Current Coverage**: 23.31%
- **Target**: 30.00%
- **Gap**: 6.69%

## Historical Performance Analysis

### Actual Session Results
Looking at our successful sessions with the simplified APR approach:

#### High-Impact Sessions (0% â†’ High Coverage)
- **Session 12** (Storage): +1.5-2% overall gain
- **Session 13** (Context Providers): +0.5% overall gain
- **Session 14** (Small Components): +0.5% overall gain

#### Moderate-Impact Sessions
- **Session 15** (Hybrid Strategy): +1.47% overall gain
- **Sessions 1-3**: +0.3-0.5% each (fixes/improvements)

#### Low-Impact Sessions
- **Sessions 9-11**: ~0% gain (complexity issues)

### Average Performance
- **Successful Sessions**: ~0.75-1.0% coverage gain per session
- **With Simplified APR**: ~1.0-1.5% per session when targeting 0% coverage files

## Realistic Projection to 30%

### Optimistic Scenario (1.5% per session)
- Gap: 6.69%
- Sessions needed: **5 sessions**
- Assumes: All sessions target high-impact 0% coverage files

### Realistic Scenario (1.0% per session)
- Gap: 6.69%
- Sessions needed: **7 sessions**
- Assumes: Mix of high and moderate impact files

### Conservative Scenario (0.75% per session)
- Gap: 6.69%
- Sessions needed: **9 sessions**
- Assumes: Increasing difficulty as easy targets are exhausted

## Recommended Approach for 30%

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Sessions 1-3)
Target remaining 0% coverage files:
- Utility functions (high ROI)
- Service files without UI
- Simple helper components
- Expected gain: +3-4%

### Phase 2: Medium Components (Sessions 4-5)
Target partially tested files (1-30% coverage):
- Complete existing partial tests
- Add missing test cases
- Expected gain: +2%

### Phase 3: Integration Tests (Sessions 6-7)
Add integration tests for critical paths:
- User registration flow
- Data sync operations
- Profile management
- Expected gain: +1.5%

## Probability Assessment

**7 Sessions to reach 30%:**
- **Confidence**: 75%
- **Reasoning**: We have proven patterns and many untested files remain
- **Risk**: Complexity increases as easy targets are depleted

**5 Sessions to reach 30%:**
- **Confidence**: 40%
- **Requires**: Perfect execution and high-impact targets only
- **Risk**: May sacrifice test quality for coverage

## Key Success Factors

1. **Continue Simplified APR**: Proven to work
2. **Focus on 0% Files**: Still have 90+ files at 0%
3. **Avoid Complex UI**: Skip large React components
4. **Target Pure Functions**: Utilities, validators, helpers
5. **Maintain Quality**: Don't pad tests just for coverage

## Conclusion

**Most Likely: 7 sessions to reach 30% coverage**

This is achievable because:
- We've established working patterns
- Plenty of untested code remains
- Simplified APR process is effective
- 30% is a realistic increment from 23.31%

The key is maintaining discipline: target high-ROI files, keep tests simple, and avoid getting bogged down in complex UI component testing.
