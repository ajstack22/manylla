# Android Library Compatibility Fix

## Problem
react-native-safe-area-context v4.14.0 was incompatible with React Native 0.81.1, causing a compilation error in the Yoga layout engine:

```
error: no member named 'unit' in 'facebook::yoga::StyleLength'
```

## Solution (Following StackMap's Approach)

### What StackMap Did:
Based on their Android Platform Guide, StackMap handled similar library incompatibilities by:
1. Re-enabling libraries with proper build tools (NDK, CMake)
2. Updating to compatible versions
3. Enabling new architecture support

### What We Did for Manylla:

1. **Updated react-native-safe-area-context from v4.14.0 to v5.6.1**
   ```bash
   npm install react-native-safe-area-context@5.6.1 --save
   ```

2. **Why this works:**
   - v5.x series is compatible with React Native 0.81.x
   - The new version uses `isDefined()` instead of deprecated `unit()` method
   - Aligns with the new Yoga API in React Native 0.81

3. **Build verification:**
   ```bash
   export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
   # BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 20s
   ```

## Results
✅ Android build now succeeds
✅ APK generated successfully (75MB)
✅ Compatible with React Native 0.81.1
✅ No more Yoga API errors

## Key Takeaway
When encountering library incompatibilities with React Native upgrades:
1. Check for newer versions of the problematic library
2. Major version bumps often align with React Native major versions
3. The error messages (like Yoga API changes) indicate breaking changes in RN core

## Files Changed
- `package.json`: Updated react-native-safe-area-context to ^5.6.1
- `package-lock.json`: Updated with new dependency version

## Testing Required
- [ ] Test on Android emulator
- [ ] Test on physical Android device
- [ ] Verify safe area insets work correctly
- [ ] Test on devices with notches/cutouts
