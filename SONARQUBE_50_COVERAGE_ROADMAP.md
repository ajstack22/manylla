  - Batch 4: Utilities & Navigation (errors, ShareDialog, hooks, RootNavigator)
  - All tests use primary color #A08670, JS-only, single-file pattern
  - Coverage improved from 21.84% to 29.27% (+7.43%)
  - Lesson learned: Batch test creation with Task agent is highly efficient
  - 53 high-quality tests for storage services (0% ‚Üí 89-100%)
  - ProfileStorageService, storageService, StorageAdapter fully tested

### Blockers Encountered:
- ~~Failing tests in photoSyncExclusion.test.js blocking deployment~~ ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- ~~React Native environment detection issues in tests~~ ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- ManyllaEncryptionService tests failing (41 tests) - needs investigation
- [Add new blockers as discovered]

### Technical Decisions:
- Using Jest + React Testing Library
- Mocking React Native components for web tests
- Development-only error logging pattern
- [Add decisions as made]
