# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Manylla community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
* **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
* **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples include:

* Using an official email address
* Posting via official social media accounts
* Acting as an appointed representative
* Contributing code or documentation

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at conduct@manylla.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
