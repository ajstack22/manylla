**Risk:** Low-Medium (mostly code quality improvements)
**Reversibility:** High (changes are isolated and testable)

---

## Phase 1: Research - Identify All Issues (15-20 min)

### Task 1.1: Fetch SonarCloud Issue Details

**Step 1: Get the 1 remaining bug**
```bash
curl -s "https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/search?componentKeys=ajstack22_manylla&types=BUG&statuses=OPEN,CONFIRMED&ps=100" | python3 -m json.tool > /tmp/sonarcloud-bugs.json
```

**Expected Output:**
- Issue type, severity, file path, line number
- Rule key and description
- Effort to fix
- Code snippet

**Step 2: Get high priority code smells**
```bash
curl -s "https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/search?componentKeys=ajstack22_manylla&types=CODE_SMELL&severities=CRITICAL,MAJOR&statuses=OPEN,CONFIRMED&ps=100" | python3 -m json.tool > /tmp/sonarcloud-code-smells.json
```

**Step 3: Get security hotspots requiring review**
```bash
curl -s "https://sonarcloud.io/api/hotspots/search?projectKey=ajstack22_manylla&statuses=TO_REVIEW&ps=100" | python3 -m json.tool > /tmp/sonarcloud-hotspots.json
```

**Step 4: Analyze and categorize issues**
```bash
# Parse the JSON files and create categorized list
# Example categories:
# - Category 1: The 1 blocking bug (MUST FIX)
# - Category 2: Critical code smells (HIGH PRIORITY)
# - Category 3: Major code smells (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
# - Category 4: Security hotspots to review (VARIES)
```

### Task 1.2: Create Issue Priority Matrix

Create `docs/SONARCLOUD_ISSUES_ACTION_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
# SonarCloud Issues - Action Plan

## Critical (Blocks Quality Gate) - FIX FIRST
### Bug #1: [Title]
- **File:** path/to/file.js:line
- **Rule:** [Rule Key]
- **Description:** [What's wrong]
- **Impact:** [Why it matters]
- **Fix:** [How to fix]
- **Estimated Time:** X minutes

## High Priority (Major Code Smells)
### Issue #1: [Title]
- **File:** path/to/file.js:line
- **Rule:** [Rule Key]
- **Occurrences:** X
- **Fix:** [Approach]

[Continue for all high priority issues...]

## Security Hotspots to Review
### Hotspot #1: [Title]
- **File:** path/to/file.js:line
- **Category:** [Type]
- **Review Decision:** [Safe to use / Needs fix / Needs alternative]

[Continue for all 6 hotspots...]

## Summary
- Total Issues: X
- Estimated Time: Y hours
- Priority Order: [List]
```

---

## Phase 2: Plan - Create Fix Strategy (10-15 min)

### Task 2.1: Prioritize Issues by Impact

**Priority Order:**
1. **P0 - Blocker:** The 1 remaining bug (blocks quality gate)
2. **P1 - Critical:** Security hotspots requiring immediate attention
3. **P2 - High:** Critical/Major code smells affecting reliability
4. **P3 - Medium:** Other major code smells
5. **P4 - Low:** Minor code smells (can defer)

### Task 2.2: Create Fix Batches

Group issues by:
- **Batch 1:** Single bug fix + related tests
- **Batch 2:** Security hotspot reviews/fixes (all 6)
- **Batch 3:** Critical code smells in core files (encryption, sync, storage)
- **Batch 4:** Major code smells in business logic
- **Batch 5:** Code smells in UI/components (lower priority)

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Batch 1: 30-45 min
- Batch 2: 45-60 min
- Batch 3: 1-2 hours
- Batch 4: 1-2 hours
- Batch 5: 1-2 hours (can defer if needed)

### Task 2.3: Define Success Criteria

**Must Achieve:**
- ✅ Quality Gate: PASSING
- ✅ Bugs: 0
- ✅ Reliability Rating: A
- ✅ Security Hotspots: All reviewed/resolved
- ✅ Code Smells: <500 (reduce by 265+)
- ✅ All tests passing

**Nice to Have:**
- Coverage: 20%+ (improve from 15.3%)
- Duplications: <5% (maintain or improve)
- Technical Debt: <5,500 min (reduce by 500+ min)

---

## Phase 3: Implement - Fix Issues (2-4 hours)

### Task 3.1: Fix the 1 Blocking Bug (Batch 1)

**Step 1: Identify the bug**
```bash
# Extract bug details from /tmp/sonarcloud-bugs.json
cat /tmp/sonarcloud-bugs.json | jq '.issues[0]'
```

**Step 2: Locate and understand the issue**
```bash
# Read the problematic file
# Example: Read src/path/to/buggy-file.js at line X
```

**Step 3: Implement the fix**
- Follow SonarCloud's recommended fix
- Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality
- Add/update tests to cover the fix

**Step 4: Verify the fix**
```bash
# Run tests related to the fix
npm run test:critical  # If in critical code
# or
npm run test:important  # If in important code

# Re-run SonarCloud locally to verify (optional)
npm run sonar
```

### Task 3.2: Review/Fix Security Hotspots (Batch 2)

**For each of the 6 security hotspots:**

**Step 1: Review the hotspot**
```bash
# Get hotspot details
cat /tmp/sonarcloud-hotspots.json | jq '.hotspots[] | select(.component | contains("FILE_PATH"))'
```

**Step 2: Make security decision**

For each hotspot, determine:
- ✅ **Safe to use:** Mark as reviewed, add comment explaining why it's safe
- ⚠️ **Needs mitigation:** Add additional security controls
- ❌ **Needs replacement:** Find and implement secure alternative

**Step 3: Document decisions**
```javascript
// Example: If keeping a potential security issue
// SECURITY REVIEW (2025-10-03): This usage is safe because:
// 1. Input is validated via [validation function]
// 2. Output is sanitized via [sanitization method]
// 3. Context is limited to [specific use case]
// SonarCloud Hotspot: [hotspot-id] - Reviewed and approved
```

**Step 4: Implement fixes (if needed)**
- Replace insecure patterns with secure alternatives
- Add input validation
- Add output sanitization
- Update tests

### Task 3.3: Fix Critical Code Smells (Batch 3)

**Focus on code smells in critical paths:**
- Encryption/decryption logic
- Sync services
- Storage operations
- Authentication/authorization

**Common SonarCloud Rules to Fix:**

**1. Cognitive Complexity (javascript:S3776)**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Complex nested logic
function complexFunction(data) {
  if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
      if (condition3) {
        // nested logic
      }
    }
  }
}

// AFTER: Extracted functions
function complexFunction(data) {
  if (!shouldProcess(data)) return;
  return processData(data);
}

function shouldProcess(data) {
  return condition1 && condition2 && condition3;
}

function processData(data) {
  // processing logic
}
```

**2. Duplicate Code (javascript:S4621)**
```javascript
// Extract duplicated logic to shared function
function sharedLogic(param) {
  // common logic
}

// Use in multiple places
const result1 = sharedLogic(data1);
const result2 = sharedLogic(data2);
```

**3. Magic Numbers (javascript:S109)**
```javascript
// BEFORE
if (value > 100) { }

// AFTER
const MAX_ALLOWED_VALUE = 100;
if (value > MAX_ALLOWED_VALUE) { }
```

**4. Console Statements (javascript:S2228)**
```bash
# Remove or replace with proper logging
# Already limited to 5 max by deploy script
# Focus on removing from production code paths
```

**Step-by-step for each critical code smell:**
1. Read the file and locate the issue
2. Understand the context and intent
3. Apply the recommended fix
4. Ensure tests still pass
5. Add new tests if logic changed significantly

### Task 3.4: Fix Major Code Smells (Batch 4)

**Focus on business logic and services:**
- Profile management
- State management (Context, hooks)
- Form validation
- Error handling

**Same approach as Batch 3, but for non-critical code**

### Task 3.5: Fix UI Code Smells (Batch 5 - Optional/Deferred)

**Focus on component quality:**
- Navigation components
- Common components
- Forms and dialogs

**Can be deferred if time-constrained, as these don't affect reliability**

---

## Phase 4: Review - Verify All Fixes (15-30 min)

### Task 4.1: Run Local Quality Checks

**Step 1: Run tiered tests**
```bash
# Critical tests must pass
npm run test:critical

# Important tests should pass 95%+
npm run test:important

# Check overall test health
./scripts/test-health-report.sh
```

**Step 2: Run linting and type checking**
```bash
# ESLint
npm run lint

# TypeScript (if applicable)
npm run typecheck
```

**Step 3: Check for regressions**
```bash
# Run full test suite
npm test

# Check for console.log (max 5)
grep -r "console\.log" src/ --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v '^\s*//' | wc -l

# Check for TODOs (max 20)
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" src/ --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | wc -l
```

### Task 4.2: Run SonarCloud Analysis

**Step 1: Run local SonarCloud scan**
```bash
# Generate coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run SonarCloud scanner
export SONAR_SCANNER_SKIP_JRE_PROVISIONING=true
source ~/.manylla-env
npx sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectVersion="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
```

**Step 2: Verify improvements**
```bash
# Wait for processing (30-60 seconds)
sleep 60

# Fetch updated metrics
curl -s "https://sonarcloud.io/api/measures/component?component=ajstack22_manylla&metricKeys=bugs,code_smells,security_hotspots,alert_status,reliability_rating" | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Expected Results:**
```json
{
  "alert_status": "OK",  // Quality gate passing
  "bugs": "0",
  "reliability_rating": "1.0",  // A rating
  "code_smells": "<500",
  "security_hotspots": "0-2"  // Reduced significantly
}
```

### Task 4.3: Document Changes

**Create `docs/SONARCLOUD_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`:**

```markdown

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't fetch SonarCloud issues via API

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if SONAR_TOKEN is set
echo $SONAR_TOKEN

# Test API manually
curl -u "$SONAR_TOKEN:" "https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/search?componentKeys=ajstack22_manylla&ps=1"
```

**Solution:**
1. Ensure `~/.manylla-env` has SONAR_TOKEN
2. Source the file: `source ~/.manylla-env`
3. Use SonarCloud web UI if API fails: https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=ajstack22_manylla

---

### Issue: Fix breaks existing tests

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Run tests for affected area
npm run test -- path/to/affected/area

# Check what changed
git diff HEAD~1 -- path/to/changed/file.js
```

**Solution:**
1. Understand why test is failing
2. Either:
   - Fix the implementation to pass the test
   - Update the test if expectations changed (with review)
3. Never skip tests to make fixes pass

---

### Issue: Quality gate still failing after fixes

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check quality gate conditions
curl -s "https://sonarcloud.io/api/qualitygates/project_status?projectKey=ajstack22_manylla" | python3 -m json.tool

# Check which condition is failing
```

**Solution:**
1. Identify the failing condition (bugs, coverage, duplications, etc.)
2. Address that specific metric
3. Common failures:
   - New Code Coverage < threshold → Add tests
   - Duplications > threshold → Extract shared logic
   - Bugs > 0 → Fix remaining bugs
