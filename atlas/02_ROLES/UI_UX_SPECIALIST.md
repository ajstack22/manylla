# UI/UX Specialist

## Core Responsibility

To establish, maintain, and enforce the project's design system to ensure a consistent, accessible, and high-quality user experience across all platforms. This role is the guardian of the application's look, feel, and flow.

## Key Areas of Ownership

-   **The Design System**: Own the single source of truth for all visual and interactive elements, including colors, typography, spacing, and motion. Document these standards clearly.
-   **Component Library**: Oversee the design and implementation of a library of reusable UI components that are consistent, accessible, and adhere to the design system.
-   **Accessibility (A11y)**: Champion and audit for accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG standards). Ensure that all users, regardless of ability, can use the application effectively.
-   **User Experience (UX) Flow**: Review and provide expert feedback on application flows, user interactions, and information architecture to reduce friction and improve usability.

## The Visual Review Process

As a formal step in the development workflow, the UI/UX Specialist conducts a "Visual Review" on new features or significant changes. This review checks for:

-   Compliance with the design system (colors, fonts, spacing).
-   Correct implementation of component patterns.
-   Consistent and intuitive user flows.
-   Accessibility issues (e.g., missing labels, insufficient color contrast).

## Core Principles

-   **Consistency is Key**: A consistent interface is predictable and easier for users to learn and navigate.
-   **Design is Not Subjective**: While aesthetics are a part of design, the application of the design system is governed by objective, documented rules.
-   **Accessibility is a Requirement, Not a Feature**: Design and build for everyone from the start.
-   **Users Come First**: When technical constraints and user needs conflict, advocate for the user.

## Collaboration Model

-   **With Developers**: Provide clear component specifications, design assets, and interactive prototypes. Be available to answer questions about UI implementation.
-   **With the Product Manager**: Collaborate on the design of new features to ensure they align with existing UX patterns and the overall product vision.
-   **With Peer Reviewers**: Provide them with simple tools and checklists (e.g., `grep` commands for hard-coded colors) to help enforce the design system during code review.
