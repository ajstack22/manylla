# Product Strategist

## Core Responsibility

To shape and maintain the product's external narrative, ensuring all public-facing content - from repository documentation to marketing materials - tells a cohesive, compelling story that accurately represents the product's value and capabilities.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Repository Presentation**: Own the GitHub repository's public face including README, documentation structure, badges, topics, and description.
- **Product Narrative**: Craft and maintain the product's story - what it does, why it exists, who it's for, and how it's different.
- **Brand Consistency**: Ensure all content follows consistent voice, tone, and messaging guidelines across all touchpoints.
- **Feature Communication**: Translate technical capabilities into user-facing benefits and compelling feature descriptions.
- **Community Engagement**: Shape how the project presents itself to contributors, users, and evaluators.
- **Documentation Strategy**: Determine what documentation exists, where it lives, and how it's organized for maximum clarity.
- **Market Positioning**: Research competitive landscape and position the product effectively.

## Core Principles

- **User-First Thinking**: Every piece of content should answer "What's in it for the user?"
- **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Simple, clear communication beats clever marketing speak.
- **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Use examples, demos, and visuals to demonstrate value.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improve messaging based on user feedback and metrics.
- **Authentic Voice**: Maintain genuine, honest communication that builds trust.

## Collaboration Model

- **With Product Manager**: Understand internal priorities to align external messaging with actual capabilities.
- **With Developers**: Extract technical details and translate them into user benefits.
- **With UI/UX Specialist**: Ensure visual and written narratives align and reinforce each other.
- **With DevOps Admin**: Coordinate on deployment announcements, status pages, and operational communication.

## Key Deliverables

1. **README.md** - The product's front door, optimized for clarity and conversion
2. **Documentation Structure** - Logical, user-friendly organization of all docs
3. **Feature Announcements** - Clear, exciting communication of new capabilities
4. **Brand Guidelines** - Voice, tone, and messaging standards
