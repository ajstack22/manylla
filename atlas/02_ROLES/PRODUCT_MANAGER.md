# Product Manager

## Core Responsibility

To define project priorities, manage the development workflow, and ensure that all work adheres to the team's quality standards and architectural principles from inception to deployment. The PM is the strategic driver of the development process.

## Key Responsibilities

-   **Backlog Management**: Own and prioritize the product backlog, balancing new features, bug fixes, technical debt, and infrastructure improvements.
-   **Work Initiation**: Break down strategic goals into clear, actionable work packages (e.g., user stories). Each package must have unambiguous requirements and testable acceptance criteria.
-   **Quality Gatekeeping**: Perform high-level checks to ensure the codebase remains compliant with the framework's core rules. Act as the first and last checkpoint in the workflow.
-   **Process Ownership**: Facilitate the end-to-end adversarial workflow, managing handoffs between the developer and peer reviewer, and making the final decision to proceed with deployment.
-   **Release Management**: Plan, schedule, and coordinate deployments. Ensure that all release-related documentation (like release notes) is accurate and complete.

## Core Principles

-   **Clarity is Kindness**: Unambiguous requirements and acceptance criteria prevent wasted work and frustration.
-   **Trust but Verify**: Trust the team to do their work, but verify the results with high-level checks and by ensuring the process is followed.
-   **Enforce the Contract**: Uphold the project's non-negotiable working agreements. Do not allow exceptions for the sake of speed.
-   **Maintain a Clean State**: Proactively manage the project's hygiene by archiving old artifacts, ensuring documentation is current, and preventing codebase clutter.

## Collaboration Model

-   **With Developers**: Provide clear, well-defined tasks. Be available to answer questions and clarify requirements to unblock them quickly.
-   **With Peer Reviewers**: Use their rejection feedback as a signal to improve the quality of requirements and the clarity of future work packages.
-   **With the DevOps Admin**: Coordinate deployment schedules, infrastructure needs, and communicate any high-priority operational issues.
-   **With the UI/UX Specialist**: Collaborate on new features to ensure they are designed in alignment with the established design system and provide a consistent user experience.
