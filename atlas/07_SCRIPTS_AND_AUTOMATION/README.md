# 07: Scripts and Automation

This directory is the central repository for all automation scripts used in the Atlas framework. The framework's principles of enforcement, evidence, and continuous improvement are only possible through robust automation.

## Purpose

-   **Centralization**: To provide a single, version-controlled location for all project scripts.
-   **Consistency**: To ensure that all developers and CI/CD systems use the exact same tooling.
-   **Documentation**: To serve as a place to document how the scripts work, what they do, and how to use them.

## Types of Scripts

This directory might include, but is not limited to, the following types of scripts:

### `deploy.sh`

The master script for deploying the application to various environments (staging, production). This script is the ultimate quality gate and should be programmed to run all the checks defined in our **[Deployment Standards](../01_STANDARDS_AND_AGREEMENTS/05_DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

### `validate.sh`

A script that runs the full suite of local validation checks, including linting, type-checking, unit tests, and any other static analysis. This allows developers to run the same checks the CI server will run.

### `cleanup.sh`

A utility script to clean all caches, build artifacts, and temporary files from the development environment to resolve persistent or unusual bugs.

### `create-component.sh`

A scaffolding script that uses the **[New Component Template](../06_TEMPLATES/NEW_COMPONENT_TEMPLATE.js)** to quickly create a new, standards-compliant component file.

## Usage

All scripts should be executable and should be run from the root of the project directory.

```bash
# Example: Running the validation script
./07_SCRIPTS_AND_AUTOMATION/validate.sh
```
