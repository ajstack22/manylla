## 🚀 How to Use

### For Users

**Start here:**
1. Read [atlas/QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md)
2. Bookmark [atlas/WORKFLOW_COMMANDS.md](WORKFLOW_COMMANDS.md)
3. Use [atlas/WORKFLOW_DECISION_TREE.md](WORKFLOW_DECISION_TREE.md) when unsure

**Typical workflow:**
```
"[TASK]. Use Atlas [Quick|Standard|Full] workflow."
```

**Example:**
```
"Fix null pointer in photo upload. Use Atlas Standard workflow."
```

### For Claude

Claude automatically:
1. Reads CLAUDE.md for context
2. Chooses appropriate workflow tier
3. Executes all phases
4. Launches agents when needed
5. Creates evidence
6. Deploys via `./scripts/deploy-qual.sh`
