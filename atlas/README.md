# Atlas Lite - The Pragmatic Edition

**üìë Complete Documentation Index**: [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) - Navigate all Atlas documentation

## What This Is

Atlas Lite is a **streamlined, battle-tested version** of the Atlas Framework, distilled from 7+ successful production waves. It contains only the essential components that actually get used - about 20% of the original codebase that delivers 100% of the value.

## The Philosophy

After extensive real-world usage, we discovered that success comes not from complex automation, but from:
- **Simple, enforceable workflows**
- **Pragmatic bash orchestration**
- **Evidence-driven development**
- **Parallel execution patterns**
- **Choosing practical over perfect**

## What's Included

### Core Workflow Scripts (The Foundation)
```
core/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ atlas_workflow.py      # Main 7-phase workflow enforcer (LEGACY)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ atlas_research.py      # Phase 1: Research guide (LEGACY)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ atlas_story.py         # Phase 2: Story creation (LEGACY)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ atlas_adversarial.py   # Phase 4: Quality review (LEGACY)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ atlas_checkpoint.py    # Checkpoint management (LEGACY)
```
**Note**: Python scripts are maintained for reference but superseded by agent-driven workflow.

### Agent Definitions (The Intelligence)
Agent definitions live in your project's `.claude/agents/` directory.
Copy the reference agents from SmilePile's setup or create your own.

**Core agents used:**
- `developer.md` - Planning & implementation
- `product-manager.md` - Story creation & validation
- `peer-reviewer.md` - Quality & edge case review
- `devops.md` - Deployment & quality gates
- `security.md` - Security auditing

### Templates (The Structure)

**üëâ NEW USER? Start here**: [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) - Simple guide with copy-paste examples
**üéØ Command Reference**: [WORKFLOW_COMMANDS.md](WORKFLOW_COMMANDS.md) - Quick lookup for workflow invocation
**üå≥ Decision Tree**: [WORKFLOW_DECISION_TREE.md](WORKFLOW_DECISION_TREE.md) - Visual guide to choosing the right tier

### Choose Your Workflow Tier üÜï

Atlas provides **three tiers** based on task complexity:

**Quick (2 phases)** - Trivial changes, 5-10 min
```
"Change button color to blue. Use Atlas Quick workflow."
```

**Standard (5 phases)** - Most tasks, 30-60 min ‚≠ê **Recommended default**
```
"Fix login bug. Use Atlas Standard workflow."
```

**Full (9 phases)** - Complex features, 2-4 hours
```
"Implement dark mode. Use Atlas Full workflow."
```

See [WORKFLOW_TIERS.md](docs/WORKFLOW_TIERS.md) for detailed decision matrix.

### Full Workflow (9 Phases)
For complex features that need comprehensive coverage:
1. **Research** - Parallel agent exploration
2. **Story creation** - Product manager agent defines requirements
3. **Planning** - Developer agents design approach
4. **Adversarial review** - Peer reviewer finds edge cases
5. **Implementation** - Parallel developer agents code
6. **Testing** - QA and review agents verify
7. **Validation** - Product manager confirms criteria
8. **Clean-up** - Organizer agent maintains hygiene
9. **Deployment** - DevOps agent with quality gates

### Legacy Script Workflow (Reference)
```bash
python3 core/atlas_workflow.py feature "Your task description"
```

## Key Success Patterns

### 1. Parallel Execution with Agents üÜï
Launch multiple agents simultaneously for independent tasks:
```
PARALLEL:
- Researcher Agent 1: Search UI components
- Researcher Agent 2: Search backend logic
- Developer Agent 1: Implement frontend
- Developer Agent 2: Implement backend
```
Result: 3-5x speed improvement through intelligent parallelization

### 2. Evidence-Driven Development
Create evidence throughout, not just at the end:
```
wave-evidence/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research-phase.md      # What you discovered
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation-log.md  # What you changed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validation-report.md   # What you verified
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ final-report.md       # Metrics & lessons
```

### 3. Pragmatic Over Perfect
- **30% test coverage** (not 80%) - covers critical paths
- **3 smoke tests** (not 50 edge cases) - real user flows
- **Simple bash scripts** (not complex orchestrators)
- **Skip options** for emergencies

### 4. Component Size Limits
- **No file > 250 lines** (hard limit)
- **Target: 150-200 lines** (sweet spot)
- **Extract at 60% duplication** (not 100%)

## What We Removed (And Why)

### ‚ùå 44+ Python Automation Scripts
- Complex state machines ‚Üí Simple bash works better
- Web dashboards ‚Üí Markdown reports are sufficient
- Trust scoring systems ‚Üí Unnecessary complexity
- Dependency graphs ‚Üí Manual planning is faster

### ‚ùå Unused Directories
- 03_AGENTS, 04_METRICS, 08_INTEGRATIONS ‚Üí Never referenced
- 07_AUTOMATION ‚Üí 44 scripts that weren't being used

### Why Removal Improved Things
The original Atlas had sophisticated automation that looked impressive but added friction. The streamlined version focuses on what actually gets used daily.

## Real-World Results

From 7 production waves:
- **Wave 1**: 8 hours (vs 24 hours traditional)
- **Zero rollbacks** across all waves
- **100% acceptance criteria** met
- **Decreasing bug discovery** with each wave

## Agent Integration for Claude Code üÜï

### Keeping It Simple
The agent workflow is powerful but must be practical within Claude Code's context limits:

**DO**:
- Use 2-3 agents in parallel maximum per phase
- Keep agent prompts concise and focused
- Save key outputs between phases

**DON'T**:
- Launch 10+ agents simultaneously
- Create massive context hand-offs
- Over-orchestrate simple tasks

### Practical Agent Usage
For most tasks, this simple pattern works best:
```
Phase 1: One researcher agent (comprehensive search)
Phase 2-4: Sequential single agents (story, plan, review)
Phase 5: 2-3 parallel developer agents (split by component)
Phase 6-8: Sequential single agents (test, validate, clean)
```

## The Core Insight

> "The Atlas system succeeds not because of rigid process, but because it combines structure with pragmatism, documentation with action, and sequential phases with parallel execution."

## Migration Guide

### From Original Atlas:
1. Archive your `07_AUTOMATION/` directory
2. Replace with these streamlined scripts
3. Keep your existing stories and evidence
4. Continue using simple bash orchestration

### From Scratch:
1. Start with `atlas_workflow.py`
2. Follow the 7 phases religiously
3. Create evidence as you go
4. Use bash for orchestration

## Best Practices

### DO ‚úÖ
- Use `atlas_workflow.py` for everything
- Create evidence throughout the process
- Run parallel tasks when possible
- Keep components under 250 lines
- Choose pragmatic solutions

### DON'T ‚ùå
- Skip phases to save time
- Batch evidence at the end
- Over-engineer the automation
- Create monolithic components
- Pursue perfection over progress

## FAQ

**Q: Why remove so much automation?**
A: It wasn't being used. Simple bash scripts achieved better results.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: Yes. This exact setup has been used for 7+ successful production waves.

**Q: Can I add back complexity?**
A: You can, but ask yourself: is it solving a real problem you're having?

**Q: How do I handle [complex scenario]?**
A: Start simple. Use the workflow. Add complexity only when simple doesn't work.
