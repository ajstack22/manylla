# ATLAS-004: iOS Security Feature Parity with Android

## Story Information
- **ID**: ATLAS-004
- **Type**: Feature
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Created**: 2025-09-25
- **Completed**: 2025-09-25
- **Epic**: Security & Parental Controls

## Problem Statement
The iOS version of SmilePile lacks several critical security features that are present in the Android version, creating feature disparity between platforms. Parents using iOS devices cannot access the same level of security control as Android users.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Pattern lock system with 3x3 grid implemented
- [x] Variable PIN length support (4-6 digits)
- [x] Functional security settings section in Settings
- [x] Authentication method switching (PIN/Pattern/Biometric)
- [x] Parental controls screen with comprehensive options
- [x] Feature parity with Android security implementation
- [x] All security data stored securely in iOS Keychain
- [x] Smooth transitions between authentication methods

## Technical Requirements

### Pattern Lock System
- 3x3 grid of touchable dots
- Minimum 4 dots for valid pattern
- Visual feedback during pattern drawing
- Pattern stored securely with hashing
- Pattern change and reset functionality

### Enhanced PIN System
- Support for 4, 5, or 6 digit PINs
- PIN length selection during setup
- Dynamic UI adjusting to PIN length
- Backward compatibility with existing 4-digit PINs

### Settings Integration
- Dedicated "Security & PIN" section
- PIN management (setup/change/remove)
- Pattern management (setup/change/remove)
- Biometric toggle controls
- Authentication method selection

### Parental Controls
- Comprehensive parental controls view
- Time restrictions configuration
- Content filtering options
- Kids Mode management

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create pattern lock infrastructure
2. Implement pattern UI components
3. Enhance PIN system for variable length
4. Create security settings views
5. Integrate with existing authentication
6. Update Keychain storage
7. Add parental controls screen
8. Testing and validation

## Success Metrics
- 100% feature parity with Android
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- All unit tests passing
- Smooth user experience
- Successful migration of existing users

## Technical Architecture

### New Components
```
ios/SmilePile/Security/
├── PatternManager.swift          # Pattern storage and validation
├── Enhanced PINManager.swift     # Variable length PIN support
└── SecurityCoordinator.swift     # Authentication method switching

ios/SmilePile/Views/Security/
├── PatternLockView.swift         # Pattern entry interface
├── PatternGridView.swift         # 3x3 grid component
└── UnifiedAuthView.swift         # Unified authentication view

ios/SmilePile/Views/Settings/
├── SecuritySettingsView.swift    # Security management UI
└── ParentalControlsView.swift    # Parental controls interface
```

### Data Flow
1. User selects authentication method in Settings
2. Method preference saved to UserDefaults
3. Authentication credentials stored in Keychain
4. ParentalLockView reads preference and shows appropriate UI
5. Authentication success unlocks protected features

## Risk Analysis
- **Risk**: Breaking existing PIN users
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility, default to 4-digit
- **Risk**: Pattern too easy to guess
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce minimum 4-dot patterns, avoid simple shapes
- **Risk**: Keychain access failures
  - **Mitigation**: Fallback mechanisms, proper error handling

## Dependencies
- iOS 15.0+ for modern SwiftUI features
- LocalAuthentication framework for biometrics
- Security framework for Keychain access

## Testing Plan
- Unit tests for PatternManager
- Unit tests for enhanced PINManager
- UI tests for pattern drawing
- Integration tests for authentication flow
- Security audit for Keychain storage
- User acceptance testing
