# 06: Continuous Improvement

This framework is not static. It is a living system that must evolve and improve. This document outlines the processes for learning from our experiences to make the framework and our product better.

## 1. The Learning Framework

We treat every failure as an opportunity to improve the system. The goal is to never make the same mistake twice.

-   **Every production bug...**
    -   ...results in a new, automated validation check being added to the deployment script or CI/CD pipeline.
-   **Every peer review rejection...**
    -   ...is an opportunity to improve our documentation, code quality standards, or developer training.
-   **Every deployment failure...**
    -   ...results in an improvement to the deployment script or process to prevent that failure mode in the future.
-   **Every performance regression...**
    -   ...results in a new performance metric being added to our monitoring and testing suites.

## 2. The Post-Mortem Process

A post-mortem is a formal process for analyzing a significant failure (like a production outage or a critical bug) to understand its root cause and prevent it from happening again. It is a blame-free process focused on improving the system, not on punishing individuals.

### When to Conduct a Post-Mortem

-   Any P0 (critical) incident.
-   Any incident involving data loss or corruption.
-   Any deployment that requires an emergency rollback.
-   Any significant performance degradation.

### Post-Mortem Template

```markdown
## Incident: [Clear, concise title of the incident]

**Date**: [Date of the incident]
**Severity**: [P0, P1, etc.]

### 1. Timeline

A detailed, timestamped log of events from detection to resolution.

-   `[HH:MM]` - Issue first detected.
-   `[HH:MM]` - Impact confirmed.
-   `[HH:MM]` - Root cause identified.
-   `[HH:MM]` - Fix deployed.
-   `[HH:MM]` - System verified as stable.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

A deep dive into what actually went wrong. Go beyond the surface-level cause (e.g., "bad code was pushed") to understand the systemic failure (e.g., "the automated tests did not have coverage for this edge case, allowing the bad code to be merged").

### 3. Impact

A quantitative and qualitative assessment of the impact.

-   **Users Affected**: [Number or percentage of users]
-   **Data Loss**: [Yes/No, and scope of loss]
-   **Duration**: [Total time of the incident]

### 4. Lessons Learned

What did we learn about our system, our processes, or our assumptions?

1.  [Key learning 1]
2.  [Key learning 2]

### 5. Action Items

A list of concrete, actionable, and assigned tasks to prevent this issue from recurring.

-   `[ ]` **Action Item 1**: (e.g., Add a new lint rule to detect the problematic pattern). Owner: [Name]. Due: [Date].
-   `[ ]` **Action Item 2**: (e.g., Update the deployment script to include a new validation check). Owner: [Name]. Due: [Date].
-   `[ ]` **Action Item 3**: (e.g., Add new monitoring for the affected system). Owner: [Name]. Due: [Date].
