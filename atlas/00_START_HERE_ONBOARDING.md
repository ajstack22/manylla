# 00: Start Here - Onboarding to the Atlas Framework

Welcome to the team and to the Atlas Framework. This framework is our comprehensive system for building high-quality, reliable software. It is built on a foundation of discipline, evidence, and continuous improvement.

This guide will walk you through the core concepts and show you where to find the information you need to be effective.

## The Core Philosophy

Our philosophy is simple: **quality is not an accident**. It is the result of a deliberate and rigorous process. We prioritize long-term stability over short-term speed. Before you dive into the details, you must understand and embrace our **[Core Principles](./01_STANDARDS_AND_AGREEMENTS/00_CORE_PRINCIPLES.md)**.

## Your First Steps

1.  **Read the Core Principles**: Start by reading and internalizing the **[00_CORE_PRINCIPLES.md](./01_STANDARDS_AND_AGREEMENTS/00_CORE_PRINCIPLES.md)**. This is the most important document in the framework.

2.  **Understand Your Role**: Find your role in the **[`02_ROLES/`](./02_ROLES/)** directory. This document defines your primary responsibilities, your areas of ownership, and how you interact with other members of the team.

3.  **Learn the Workflow**: Read the **[`ADVERSARIAL_WORKFLOW.md`](./03_PROCESSES/ADVERSARIAL_WORKFLOW.md)**. This document explains the step-by-step process that takes every piece of work from an idea to a deployed feature. It is the engine of our development process.

4.  **Review the Standards**: Familiarize yourself with the documents in the **[`01_STANDARDS_AND_AGREEMENTS/`](./01_STANDARDS_AND_AGREEMENTS/)** directory. These are the specific, measurable rules that we all follow. Pay special attention to the standards most relevant to your role.

## How to Use This Framework

-   **When you have a task**: Follow the `ADVERSARIAL_WORKFLOW.md`. Your role document will explain your part in that process.
-   **When you are writing code**: Adhere to the `01_CODE_QUALITY.md` and `02_WORKFLOW_STANDARDS.md`.
-   **When you are reviewing code**: Embody the principles in `03_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md`.
-   **When you have a platform-specific question**: Consult the relevant guide in the `04_PLATFORMS/` directory.
-   **When you want to understand why we do things this way**: Read the case studies in the `05_LEARNINGS/` directory.

This framework is the key to our success. By embracing it, you will help us continue to build exceptional software.
