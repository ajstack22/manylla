# Ideas for the Atlas Framework

This document contains a list of ideas for how we can improve the Atlas Framework.

## 1. Automated Adversarial Workflow

We can build a script that automates the "Adversarial Workflow". The script would:

*   **Guide the user through the workflow:** The script would prompt the user for the necessary information at each stage of the workflow, from "Prioritization" to "Deployment".
*   **Automate the handoffs:** The script would automatically assign the work to the correct person at each stage of the workflow. For example, when the developer has finished their work, the script would automatically assign the work to a peer reviewer.
*   **Track the status of the work:** The script would track the status of the work as it moves through the workflow. This would allow us to see at a glance where everything is in the process.

## 2. Interactive Core Principles Guide

We can create an interactive guide to the "Core Principles". The guide would:

*   **Explain the principles in detail:** The guide would provide a detailed explanation of each principle, with examples and case studies.
*   **Test the user's understanding:** The guide would include quizzes and exercises to test the user's understanding of the principles.
*   **Provide feedback:** The guide would provide feedback to the user on their performance in the quizzes and exercises.

## 3. Centralized Knowledge Base

We can create a centralized knowledge base for the Atlas Framework. The knowledge base would:

*   **Contain all the documentation for the framework:** The knowledge base would contain all the documentation for the framework, including the "Core Principles", the "Adversarial Workflow", and the standards and agreements.
*   **Be searchable:** The knowledge base would be searchable, so that users can easily find the information they need.
*   **Be versioned:** The knowledge base would be versioned, so that users can track changes to the framework over time.

## 4. "Elimination Over Addition" Linter

We can create a linter that helps to enforce the "Elimination Over Addition" principle. The linter would:

*   **Identify duplicate code:** The linter would identify duplicate code in the codebase.
*   **Identify dead code:** The linter would identify dead code in the codebase.
*   **Suggest refactorings:** The linter would suggest refactorings that would simplify the codebase.
