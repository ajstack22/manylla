# Handoffs

This document describes how we handle handoffs in the Adversarial Workflow.

## The Problem

The Adversarial Workflow is a collaborative process. It involves multiple people, each with their own roles and responsibilities. As a work item moves through the workflow, it is handed off from one person to another. For example, when a developer finishes their work, they hand it off to a peer reviewer. When the peer reviewer finishes their review, they hand it off to the DevOps admin for integration.

The problem is that these handoffs are currently manual. The person who is next in line to work on the item may not know that it is their turn. This can lead to delays and bottlenecks in the workflow.

## The Solution

We will automate the handoffs in the workflow by using a combination of Git hooks and a project management tool.

### Git Hooks

We will use Git hooks to automatically trigger actions when certain events occur. For example, when a developer pushes a new branch to the remote repository, a Git hook will automatically create a new pull request and assign it to a peer reviewer.

### Project Management Tool

We will use a project management tool to track the status of work items and to notify users when they have a new task. For example, when a new pull request is created, the project management tool will automatically create a new task and assign it to the peer reviewer. The peer reviewer will then receive a notification that they have a new task.

## The Benefits

By automating the handoffs in the workflow, we will:

*   Reduce the cycle time of the workflow
*   Prevent delays and bottlenecks in the workflow
*   Make it clear who is responsible for the work at each stage of the workflow
*   Improve the quality of our work
