# Release & Deployment Process

## Overview
A systematic process for releasing software versions and deploying to production environments. This process ensures that every release is properly versioned, tested, documented, and safely deployed with rollback capabilities.

## When to Use
- Deploying new features to production
- Releasing bug fixes
- Updating dependencies
- Emergency hotfixes
- Scheduled maintenance deployments
- Major version releases

## Process Script
**Script**: `07_SCRIPTS_AND_AUTOMATION/release_deployment.py`
**Usage**:
```bash
python release_deployment.py --type minor      # Minor version release
python release_deployment.py --type patch      # Patch/bugfix release
python release_deployment.py --type major      # Major version release
python release_deployment.py --hotfix          # Emergency hotfix
python release_deployment.py --rollback        # Rollback to previous
```

## Process Owner
**Role**: ORCHESTRATOR coordinating DEVOPS ADMIN
- Orchestrator coordinates the release process
- DevOps Admin agents handle actual deployment
- Never deploys directly, always through agents

## Release Types

### Major Release (X.0.0)
- Breaking changes
- Major features
- Architecture changes
- Requires migration guide
- Extended testing period

### Minor Release (0.X.0)
- New features
- Backward compatible
- No breaking changes
- Standard testing

### Patch Release (0.0.X)
- Bug fixes only
- Security patches
- No new features
- Minimal testing

### Hotfix
- Critical production fix
- Expedited process
- Minimal testing
- Immediate deployment

## The 7-Phase Release Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Release Validation
**Objective**: Ensure code is ready for release

**Orchestrator Actions**:
1. Spawn validation agent
2. Review validation results
3. Decision: proceed or abort

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code coverage meets threshold
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG prepared

**Success Criteria**:
- All checks green
- Ready for release

### Phase 2: Version Management
**Objective**: Properly version the release

**Orchestrator Actions**:
1. Spawn versioning agent
2. Review version number
3. Approve version bump

**Versioning Activities**:
- Determine version type (major/minor/patch)
- Update version in package files
- Tag in version control
- Update CHANGELOG

**Semantic Versioning**:
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

MAJOR: Breaking changes
MINOR: New features, backward compatible
PATCH: Bug fixes only
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Version correctly bumped
- Git tag created
- CHANGELOG updated

### Phase 3: Build & Package
**Objective**: Create deployable artifacts

**Orchestrator Actions**:
1. Spawn build agents (parallel if multiple platforms)
2. Monitor build progress
3. Verify artifacts created

**Build Activities**:
- Clean build environment
- Compile/transpile code
- Bundle dependencies
- Create artifacts
- Sign packages if required

**Artifact Types**:
- Docker images
- NPM packages
- Compiled binaries
- ZIP/TAR archives
- Cloud functions

**Success Criteria**:
- All artifacts built
- Checksums verified
- Ready for deployment

### Phase 4: Staging Deployment
**Objective**: Deploy to staging environment

**Orchestrator Actions**:
1. Spawn staging deployment agent
2. Monitor deployment
3. Spawn testing agents
4. Review test results

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Deploy to staging
2. Run smoke tests
3. Run integration tests
4. Run performance tests
5. Manual verification

**Testing Matrix**:
| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Smoke Tests | | |
| Integration | | |
| Performance | | |
| Security Scan | | |
| User Acceptance | | |

**Success Criteria**:
- Staging deployment successful
- All tests pass
- No regressions detected

### Phase 5: Production Deployment
**Objective**: Deploy to production safely

**Orchestrator Actions**:
1. Spawn production deployment agent
2. Monitor deployment progress
3. Coordinate rollout strategy
4. Verify deployment success

**Deployment Strategies**:

**Blue-Green**:
```
Current (Blue) → New (Green)
Test Green → Switch traffic → Monitor
```

**Rolling**:
```
Instance 1 → Update → Verify
Instance 2 → Update → Verify
Instance N → Update → Verify
```

**Canary**:
```
5% traffic → Monitor → 25% → Monitor → 100%
```

**Feature Flags**:
```
Deploy with flag OFF → Test → Enable gradually
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Deployment successful
- Health checks passing
- No errors in logs

### Phase 6: Post-Deployment Verification
**Objective**: Ensure production is healthy

**Orchestrator Actions**:
1. Spawn monitoring agents
2. Collect metrics
3. Compare with baselines
4. Decision: complete or rollback

**Monitoring Checklist**:
- [ ] Application health checks
- [ ] Error rates normal
- [ ] Performance metrics stable
- [ ] Database connections healthy
- [ ] External services connected
- [ ] User traffic normal

**Key Metrics**:
- Response time
- Error rate
- Throughput
- CPU/Memory usage
- Database performance

**Success Criteria**:
- All metrics within normal range
- No user complaints
- System stable

### Phase 7: Release Communication
**Objective**: Inform stakeholders

**Orchestrator Actions**:
1. Spawn communication agent
2. Review announcements
3. Approve distribution

**Communication Outputs**:
- Release notes for users
- Technical changelog
- Migration guides (if needed)
- API documentation updates
- Status page updates

**Distribution Channels**:
- GitHub Releases
- Product blog
- Email to users
- Slack/Discord
- Status page

**Success Criteria**:
- All stakeholders informed
- Documentation published
- Support team briefed

## Rollback Process

### When to Rollback
- Critical bug in production
- Performance degradation >20%
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Data integrity issues
- User experience severely impacted

### Rollback Procedure
1. **Immediate**: Revert traffic to previous version
2. **Investigate**: Determine root cause
3. **Fix**: Create hotfix if needed
4. **Test**: Verify fix in staging
5. **Re-deploy**: Follow expedited release process

### Rollback Strategies
```bash
# Blue-Green: Switch back to blue
kubectl set traffic blue=100 green=0

# Rolling: Redeploy previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/app

# Feature Flag: Disable feature
flagsmith disable feature_x

# Database: Run migration rollback
npm run migrate:rollback
```

## Emergency Hotfix Process

### Expedited Path
```
Identify Issue → Create Fix → Test Minimum → Deploy → Monitor
     (5m)          (30m)         (15m)        (10m)     (30m)
```

### Hotfix Criteria
- Production breaking bug
- Security vulnerability
- Data loss risk
- Revenue impact

### Hotfix Protocol
1. Create hotfix branch from production
2. Implement minimal fix
3. Run critical tests only
4. Deploy with careful monitoring
5. Full testing after deployment
6. Merge back to development

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Deploying without staging validation
- ❌ Skipping tests for speed
- ❌ No rollback plan
- ❌ Deploying on Fridays
- ❌ Not monitoring after deployment
- ❌ Poor communication

## When Deployment Fails

If deployment cannot complete:
1. Immediate rollback
2. Investigate in staging
3. Create hotfix if critical
4. Schedule maintenance window if complex
5. Communicate with users
