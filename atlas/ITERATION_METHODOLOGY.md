# Atlas Iteration Methodology: Build-Test-Grow

## Core Principle: Always Working, Always Tested

**Every iteration produces a working, tested system that's slightly better than the last.**

## The Problem We're Solving

The current "build everything then integrate" approach causes:
- ‚ùå Massive integration failures at the end
- ‚ùå Untested code accumulating
- ‚ùå No working system until everything is "done"
- ‚ùå Test coverage becomes a huge task at the end
- ‚ùå Debugging nightmares when nothing works together

## The Solution: Incremental Vertical Slices with Tests

### 1. Start with Minimal Working System (MWS)
The smallest possible system that:
- ‚úÖ Compiles
- ‚úÖ Runs
- ‚úÖ Has one basic test
- ‚úÖ Can be demonstrated

**Example for SmilePile:**
```kotlin
// Iteration 0: Display one image
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        // Just show one hardcoded image
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    }
}

// Test for Iteration 0
@Test
fun testAppLaunches() {
    val scenario = launchActivity<MainActivity>()
    onView(withId(R.id.imageView)).check(matches(isDisplayed()))
}
```

### 2. Each Iteration Adds ONE Feature + Tests

**The Iteration Formula:**
```
Previous Working Code + One New Feature + Tests for That Feature = New Working System
```

## Test Accumulation Strategy

### Coverage Goals by Iteration
- Iteration 1: 20% coverage (basic smoke tests)
- Iteration 3: 40% coverage (core paths)
- Iteration 5: 60% coverage (main features)
- Iteration 7: 80% coverage (edge cases)
- Final: 85%+ coverage

### Test Types to Add Each Iteration

#### With UI Features
- Unit test for any new classes/methods
- UI test for the new screen/interaction
- Integration test if it touches data

#### With Data Features
- Unit test for data models
- Database test for operations
- Mock tests for repositories

#### With Business Logic
- Unit tests for all logic paths
- Edge case tests
- Error handling tests

## The Parallel Optimization

While maintaining iterative development, we can still parallelize:

```
During Iteration N:
‚îú‚îÄ Developer A: Implementing Feature N + Tests
‚îú‚îÄ Developer B: Refactoring code from N-1 + Adding more tests
‚îú‚îÄ Tester C: Creating test scenarios for N+1
‚îî‚îÄ Researcher D: Investigating approach for N+2
```

## Key Rules for Iterations

### The Five Commandments

1. **Thou Shalt Not Break the Build**
   - Every iteration MUST compile
   - Every iteration MUST pass existing tests

2. **Thou Shalt Write Tests First (When Possible)**
   - TDD approach: Write test, watch it fail, make it pass
   - At minimum: Write tests WITH the feature

3. **Thou Shalt Not Skip Tests**
   - No feature is "too simple" to test
   - No iteration is complete without tests

4. **Thou Shalt Accumulate Coverage**
   - Each iteration adds to total coverage
   - Never let coverage decrease

5. **Thou Shalt Demo Each Iteration**
   - If you can't demo it, it's not done
   - Working software over comprehensive documentation

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Development
- ‚úÖ Always have working software
- ‚úÖ Catch integration issues immediately
- ‚úÖ Natural checkpoints for progress
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging (smaller changes)

### For Testing
- ‚úÖ Tests grow organically with code
- ‚úÖ No massive "testing sprint" at end
- ‚úÖ Coverage increases steadily
- ‚úÖ Tests stay relevant to current code

### For Project Management
- ‚úÖ Can demo at any point
- ‚úÖ Clear progress metrics
- ‚úÖ Risk mitigation (always have something)
- ‚úÖ Easy to pivot if requirements change

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### In Orchestrator Prompt
```markdown
You MUST follow iterative development:
1. Start with Minimal Working System
2. Each wave adds ONE feature + tests
3. Never proceed without passing tests
4. Commit only working, tested code
```

### In Developer Agent Context
```python
'constraints': [
    'MUST build on existing working code',
    'MUST write tests for new features',
    'MUST ensure all tests pass',
    'MUST maintain or increase coverage',
    'NEVER commit untested code'
]
```

### In Iteration Manager Script
```python
def can_proceed_to_next_iteration():
    """Check if we can move forward"""
    return (
        build_passes() and
        all_tests_pass() and
        coverage_increased() and
        feature_is_demoed()
    )
```

## Migration Path for Existing Projects

If starting with a non-iterative codebase:

1. **Find the MWS** - What's the smallest part that works?
2. **Add tests to MWS** - Get baseline coverage
3. **Pick smallest feature** - Start iteration cycle
4. **Gradually refactor** - Improve as you iterate

## Success Metrics

- üéØ Every iteration produces deployable software
- üéØ Test coverage grows by 10-15% per iteration
- üéØ Zero "integration hell" moments
- üéØ Can demo progress daily
- üéØ New team members can contribute immediately
