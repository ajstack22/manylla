Usage:
------
1. Start with 00_Prompt.md as your main orchestrator prompt
2. It ends with "In order to complete this work:"
3. Add your specific project/story/requirements after that line
4. Include the supporting files for additional context as needed

The 00_Prompt.md file contains the core orchestrator instructions that:
- Enforces git initialization first
- Requires parallel agent execution (3-5 agents)
- Mandates build verification before proceeding
- Includes adversarial review requirements
- Prevents destructive operations
