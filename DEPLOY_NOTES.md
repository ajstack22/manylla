# Deploy Notes

Add notes here for the next deployment...

## How to use:
- Add a title on the first line for your deployment
- The script will use it for the git commit message
- This file auto-clears after each deployment

## Example:
```
Fixed sync issues and improved dark mode
- Updated sync service endpoints
- Fixed contrast in dark mode inputs
```
