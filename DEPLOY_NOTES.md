# Deploy Notes

## 2025_09_06_01 - Phase 1 Security Hardening Complete
Completed all Phase 1 critical security tasks including share encryption fixes, API input validation, and comprehensive rate limiting on both client and server sides.

### Changes
- **Share Encryption Fix (Task 1.1)**
  - Fixed critical vulnerability: recipientName and note metadata now encrypted
  - All sensitive share data properly encrypted before localStorage
  - Backward compatibility maintained for existing shares
  - Fixed share URL routing for subdirectory deployments (/qual/)

- **API Input Validation (Task 1.2)**
  - Added validation to all sync API endpoints
  - Validates sync_id (32 hex chars), device_id (32 hex chars), invite codes (XXXX-XXXX format)
  - Uses centralized validation utilities for consistency
  - Proper error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

- **Client-Side Rate Limiting (Task 1.3)**
  - Enforces 200ms minimum interval between API requests
  - Added makeRequest() wrapper for all API calls
  - Prevents API flooding and reduces server load
  - Console logging for rate limit debugging

- **Server-Side Rate Limiting (Task 1.4)**
  - Created comprehensive rate-limiter.php utility
  - IP-based limiting: 120 requests/minute
  - Device-based limiting: 60 requests/minute  
  - New device protection: 60-second delay before sync
  - Data reduction protection: Blocks >50% data loss attempts
  - Suspicious activity monitoring for rapid device switching

### Technical Details
- Rate limiting uses file-based caching (ready for Redis upgrade)
- All API endpoints now validate and rate limit before processing
- Share URLs use path format `/share/[token]#[key]` for clean URLs
- Added explicit RewriteRules in .htaccess for share and sync routes
- Fixed Apache routing issues with subdirectory deployments

## 2025_09_05_01 - Critical Security Enhancements
Implemented comprehensive security fixes for medical data protection including encrypted share storage, secure code generation, URL fragment clearing, rate limiting, and data integrity checks.

### Changes
- **Share Security**
  - Encrypted share data in localStorage using XSalsa20-Poly1305
  - Replaced Math.random() with crypto.getRandomValues() for share codes
  - Added decryption logic with backward compatibility
  - Share codes now use 8-character secure hex strings

- **Sync Security**
  - Added URL fragment clearing to prevent recovery phrase exposure in browser history
  - Implemented rate limiting (max 1 pull/2s, max 1 push/5s)
  - Added runaway pull prevention (stops after 100 attempts)
  - Recovery phrases cleared from memory after 30 seconds

- **Data Integrity**
  - Added HMAC authentication to encrypted medical data
  - Integrity verification on all sync operations
  - Backward compatibility maintained for existing data

- **React Fixes**
  - Fixed useCallback hook conditional call error in App.tsx
  - Removed duplicate hook definitions

### Technical Details
- Encryption: 1000 nacl.hash iterations for key derivation
- Share encryption uses share code as key source with salt
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse and runaway sync loops
- HMAC provides tamper detection for medical data
- All security fixes maintain backward compatibility
