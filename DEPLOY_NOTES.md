## 2025-01-04 - UI/UX Improvements

### Modal Aesthetic Updates
- Applied consistent design pattern across all major modals (Sync, Add Entry, Edit Profile, Manage Categories)
- Added centered large icons (64px), bold titles, and descriptive subtitles to all modals
- Implemented panel-based layouts with 2px borders and hover effects for better visual hierarchy
- Standardized DialogActions padding (px: 2, py: 2) across all modals

### Share Modal Wizard Implementation
- Converted Share modal from single-page form to 4-step wizard for improved UX
- Step 1: Select recipient type (Teacher, Babysitter, Medical Team, Family, Custom)
- Step 2: Choose content to share (Quick Info and/or specific categories)
- Step 3: Configure access settings (expiration, notes)
- Step 4: Display generated access code and shareable link
- Fixed share URL generation to use Manylla domain instead of StackMap

### Icon Updates
- Changed Categories button in header from Settings icon to Label icon
