⚠️ DEPLOYMENT REMINDER FOR AI ASSISTANTS ⚠️
==========================================

If you're reading this file while working on the codebase,
remember that deployment to QUAL must ONLY be done via:

./scripts/deploy-qual.sh

DO NOT:
- Use npm run deploy:qual
- Manually copy files to the server
- Skip validation checks
- Deploy with uncommitted changes
- Deploy without updating release notes

The deployment script will:
1. Validate all code quality checks
2. Require updated release notes
3. Build and test the project
4. Commit and push to GitHub
5. Deploy to the qual environment

If deployment fails, DO NOT bypass the checks.
Fix the underlying issue instead.

See /DEPLOYMENT_RULES.md for full details.
