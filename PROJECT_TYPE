REACT_NATIVE_WITH_WEB_WEBPACK

# DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE
# This file tells AI assistants what type of project this is

Type: React Native + Web (Unified Codebase)
Web Build Tool: Webpack (NOT Create React App)
Mobile Build Tool: React Native CLI

Critical Commands:
- Web Development: npm run web (port 3000)
- Mobile Development: npm start (Metro bundler)
- NEVER use: npx react-scripts start (this is NOT a CRA project)

If you see errors about:
- JSX in node_modules/react-native-* → Wrong build tool, use npm run web
- Module resolution for .native files → Wrong build tool, use npm run web
- AsyncStorage not found → This is expected, webpack aliases handle it

Key Files That Prove This:
- webpack.config.js exists → Webpack for web
- index.web.js exists → Web entry point
- *.web.js/tsx files → Platform-specific web implementations
- NO src/index.js → NOT a Create React App project
